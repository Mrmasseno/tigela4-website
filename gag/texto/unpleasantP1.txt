"I guess. Why should I ?"
"Nope. And I'd rather not."
"Sure, whatever."
"No, why?"
"Finally! Some time without smelling your putrid odor ."
"Yeah, whatever."
"Of course,"
"it's completely ridiculous."
"It's a delicious idea, but so impracticable it doesn't really bear thinking about at all."
"Look, Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>!"
"Look at these!"
"Is your old head brain frying? This has potencial, you just don't see it!"
"I'm gonna sit down"
"I'm now going tell you about how I came to do all this."
"You've been seeing me acting a little strange lately, and this is why."
"You see, Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>, I don't really care much for my work here. I know I'm good at it and all that sort of thing, but this means nothing to me, and I'm tired of hearing your voice to be quite honest."
"I'm gonna be a writer Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>."
"Yes, Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>. You may not believe it, but every bit of spare time I've had away from this depressing ass office, I've spent writing stories. In the last ten years I've written hundreds, literally hundreds of short stories. Five hundred and sixty-six, to be precise. Approximately one a week."
"First because I want too, second because I have the urge to do it."
"The creative urge, Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>."
"That's the bad part, because I know I'm writing all these interesting stories but no god forsaken magazine will take my stuff, and it's starting to piss me off."
"You haven't even read them, how can you possibily say that? You're just probably jealous, but whatever. My god, when you compare them with the stuff some of those magazines print – oh my word, Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>! – the sloppy, boring stuff that you see in the magazines week after week – why, it drives me mad!"
"Do you even read the magazines, Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>?" 
"Everything, Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>, absolutely everything! What I want to tell you is, I've made a study of magazines, and it seems that each one tends to have its own particular type of story. The writers – the successful ones – know this, and they write accordingly."
"Shut up and hear me now Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>, let me finish."
"So you see, on my machine, by having an adjustable coordinator between the 'plot-memory' section and the 'word-memory' section I am able to produce any type of story I desire simply by pressing the required button."
"Just this, Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>. The market is limited. We've got to be able to produce the right stuff, at the right time, whenever we want it. It's a matter of business, that's all. I'm looking at it from your point of view now – as a commercial proposition, because that's all you ever think about."
"Of course I do. You're the one who doesn't know things here, because if you did, you would know how much these magazines pay to their writers."
"Anything up to twenty-five hundred dollars. It probably averages around a thousand."
"Exactly Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>, I bet now you like the idea."
"It is true, didn't you hear me the first time? It's probably your ears failing already."
"That's exactly it, Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>! That's where the machine comes in. Listen a minute, Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>, while I tell you some more. I've got it all worked out. The big magazines are carrying approximately three fiction stories in each issue. Now, take the fifteen most important magazines – the ones paying the most money. A few of them are monthlies, but most of them come out every week. All right. That makes, let us say, around forty big stories being bought each week. That's forty thousand dollars. So with our machine – when we get it working properly – we're gonna be swimming in green!"
"No, Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>, You're just jealous because you didn't have this idea first. Don't you see that with volume alone we'll completely overwhelm them! This machine can produce a five-thousand-word story, all typed and ready for dispatch, in thirty seconds. How can the writers compete with that? I ask you, Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>, how?"
"Nowadays, Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>, the hand-made article hasn't a hope. It can't possibly compete with massproduction, especially in this country – you know that. Corkscrews … cigarettes … basketballs … bricks … lighters … anything you like to mention – they're all made by machinery now. The quality may be inferior, but that doesn't matter. It's the cost of production that counts. And stories – well – they're just another product, like bricks and lighters, and no one cares how you produce them so long as you deliver the goodies. We'll sell them wholesale, Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>! We'll undercut every writer in the country! We'll corner the market!"
"Forty thousand a week!"
"And if we halve the price, making it twenty thousand a week, that's still a million a year!"
"You didn't get any million a year for building the old electronic calculator, did you, Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>?"
"Listen, Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>. Who on earth is going to want custom-made stories when they can get the other kind at half the price? It stands to reason, doesn't it?"
"We'll set up our own literary agency, and we'll distribute them through that. And we'll invent all the names we want for the writers."
"And another thing, Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>. There's all manner of valuable by-products once you've got started. Take advertising, for example. Beer manufacturers and people like that are willing to pay good money these days if famous writers will lend their names to their products. Why, my god, Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>! This isn't the playground no more. It's big business."
"And another thing. There isn't any reason why we shouldn't put your name, Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>, on some of the better stories, and that's just because I pity you Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>"
"I don't know, Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>, except that some writers get to be very much respected – like Mr Erle Gardner or Kathleen Morris, for example. We've got to have names, and I was certainly thinking of using my own on one or two stories, so I can get some credit."
"Yeah you heard me right, Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>."
"We feed those in, Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>. That's no problem at all. Everyone has plots. There's three or four hundred of them written down in that folder there on your left. Feed them straight into the "plot-memory" section of the machine."
"There are many other little refinements too, Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>. You'll see them all when you study the plans carefully. For example, there's a trick that nearly every writer uses, of inserting at least one long, obscure word into each story. This makes the reader think that the man is very wise and clever. So I have the machine do the same thing. There'll be a whole stack of long words stored away just for this purpose."
"In the "word-memory" section,"
"Exactly, Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>."
"Which button?"
"You choose, Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>. Lots of magazines to pick from – Saturday Evening Post, Collier's, Ladies" Home Journal – any one you like."
"Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>,"
"do you realize that at this moment, with your little finger alone, you have it in your power to become the most versatile writer on this continent?"
"OK, Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>. Then we'll make it… let me see – this one. How's that?"
"So much for the selection,"
"Now – here we go!"
"That's it!"
"There's your story!"
"Ok you need to calm down Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>. We've got a connection wrong somewhere, that's all. There's over a million feet of wiring in this room. You can't expect everything to be right first time."
"Chill out Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>."
"No Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>, can't you see this is for the Digest?"
"No,Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>, it's fine. Can't you see? It's simply that she's not breaking up the words. That's an easy adjustment. But the story's there. Look, Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>, look! It's all there except that the words are joined together."
"I told you Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>. This is exactly right!"
"No, Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>, it's a seller, a real seller!"
"And so you will, Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>. And so you will. But you need to chill out a bit. This is a very complicated adjustment I have to make."
"We're going to do novels,"
"Just as many as we want. But please be patient."
"A monkey? Oh I see, you finally went insane Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>"
"No Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>, what the hell?!"
"Look, Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>. With the sort of switchboard I'm rigging up, you'll be able to write any sort of book you want."
"You'll soon get used to it, Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>. In a week or two, you'll be doing it without hardly thinking. It's not like you do it anyway."
"I'm sure you will, Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>"
"Are you ready Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>?"
"Congratulations on your first novel,"
"Yeah, such hard work Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>."
"I must say it's a bit fruity."
"I don't know Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>, It's seems good enough for your capabilities."
"No... What? No... What? No..."
"You don't think, Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>, that you mightn't have been pressing a little hard on the passioncontrol pedals, do you?"
"Just try another one."
"See here, Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>,"
"We still got too much competition. We're gonna take out these clowns."
"Of course you can Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>. Exactly like Rockefeller did with his oil companies. Simply buy "em out, and if they won't sell, squeeze "em out. It's easy!"
"I've got a list here Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>, of fifty of the most successful writers in the country, and what I intend to do is offer each one of them a lifetime contract with pay. All they have to do is undertake never to write another word; and, of course, to let us use their names on our own stuff. How about that?"
"You don't know writers, Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>. You watch and see."
"It's bunk! All they're really interested in is the money – just like everybody else."
"Madam,"
"Come with me and see it with your own eyes. My car awaits you."
"All right,"
"you want to do a book now?"
"That's one of them out of the way,"
"A pretty big one too."
"And you know why she signed?"
"It wasn't the money. She's got plenty of that."
"Simply because she saw the machine-made stuff was better than her own."
