"Oh hey there, <span class="apelidoVermelho personagem">Knipe</span>. Now that we're done, I called you here because you've done... a fantastic job."
"Oh, are you not happy about it?"
"Have you had the chance to lay your soft, blue eyes upon the newspapers?"
"Aren't you proud, <span class="apelidoVermelho personagem">Knipe</span>? Aren't you... pleased?"
"Listen, buddy. You've done a lot here, and I appreciate you. Your contribution was... enticing. Even more, without your little ideas we'd still be stuck at square one."
"Oh, is anything on your mind, <span class="apelidoVermelho personagem">Knipe</span>?"
"You look... flushed."
"Listen, go take a holiday. It'll do you good. You've... earned it."
"I would love it if you went on holiday, <span class="apelidoVermelho personagem">Knipe</span>. You really need it."
"Take a week, two maybe. Go somewhere warm, get some sunshine. Swim, relax. Sleep. Then come back and we'll have a very pleasant talk about the future."
"Hot damn, <span class="apelidoVermelho personagem">Knipe</span>, you look so much butter now, How was your holiday, did ou have fun?"
"You look a hundred per cent better, my boy."
"This... this is definitely not what I expected."
"Hey, take it easy. We're all friends here. Listen to me."
"This idea,"
"is extremely ingenious - maybe a little bit brilliant - and it shows just how magnificent your abilities are. But don't take it too seriously. I mean, my boy, how are we gonna use it? Who wants a machine specifically for writing stories? I can think of a few machines that don't necessarily write stories that have more uses than this. And where's the money in it anyway?"
"Why of course, my boy. Take a seat. Make yourself comfortable."
"Oh, go right ahead."
"You can tell me anything you want, boy. I'm here to help you, like I've always been."
"Oh, a writer, aye?"
"That's... a lot of stories, are there any for me? Why did you write so many stories, my boy?"
"What sort of urge, if you know what I mean?"
"And what does this urge compel you to do with these stories?"
"At least you're looking a lot better now, my boy."
"We all go through that at some point. But maybe with all of the experts' opinions, you will realize that your stories are... hardly successful. It's time you retired from that, and just forget about it."
"Now hold on a second, there."
"Excuse me, but what does this have to do with out little machine here?"
"Wait a minute. Calm down, you're becoming agitated. Let's relax a little, this isn't going anywhere."
"I know, I know, this is really interesting, but I don't really see the... point of it."
"Oh <span class="apelidoVermelho personagem">Knipe</span>, you're so silly. This can't be commercial proposition - ever. You know just as well as I do that these machines cost a lot of money to build."
"And what do they pay?"
"Now that's just ridiculous, <span class="apelidoVermelho personagem">Knipe</span>! You're dreaming!"
"You mean to sit there like that and tell me these magazines pay ou money like that to a man...just for a single story? What's next? Why aren't you a millionaire yet, young boy?"
"Oh my dear <span class="apelidoVermelho personagem">Knipe</span>, you've gone cuckoo crazy!"
"I still think it needs some more work, boy."
"But seriously now, do you really think the stories are good enough for them to buy them?"
"And how will you sell them? Are we going to make up someone's name to credit?"
"I'm not sure I like it as much as you, <span class="apelidoVermelho personagem">Knipe</span>. This seems very naugty coming from you."
"Now now, don't get too ambitious with this idea, young man."
"My goodness, <span class="apelidoVermelho personagem">Knipe</span>! Why would I want that?"
"A writer, eh?"
"Well, it would surely surprise the boys over at the... club... when they saw my name in the good magazines."
"One thing I don't exactly get, <span class="apelidoVermelho personagem">Knipe</span>, is where do the plots come from? The machine doesn't  just birth them from nowhere, does it?"
"Oh, now we're talking."
"And where would we stack those... long words?"
"What we're going to do, boy, is say we're just having fun making another mathematical machine, but a different type. They will never know our little secret."
"Oh sweet jesus, <span class="apelidoVermelho personagem">Knipe</span>? How do I pick one?"
"Listen, <span class="apelidoVermelho personagem">Knipe</span>, let's get on with it, if you please... leave out the... foreplay."
"I'm sorry, <span class="apelidoVermelho personagem">Knipe</span>, I think this will never work..."
"It'll never work,"
"I know it. I'm so upset..."
"That's all of it?"
"Why did it stop? It's gone wrong!"
"I can't understand any of it!"
"Oh I don't know, <span class="apelidoVermelho personagem">Knipe</span>, it seems rather sloppy."
"Oh, <span class="apelidoVermelho personagem">Knipe</span>. I want to do a novel,"
"I want to do a novel so bad."
"Everyone keeps saying I need to do a novel, <span class="apelidoVermelho personagem">Knipe</span>. All sorts of publishers are chasing after me, day and night, begging me to stop writing those silly stories and move on to something really big and important, like a novel."
"Now listen to me, boy. I'm going to do a very serious novel, something that'll make 'em sit up and notice me. I've been getting rahter tired of these short storiettes you've been crediting me for and honestly I feel like you're making a little monkey outta me."
"You've just been taking all of the best stories and the biggest profit for yourself, that's what's been happening."
"So this time I'm going to make sure I write a high class intelligent book. You would understand that."
"Good grief, <span class="apelidoVermelho personagem">Knipe</span>! I'll never be able to do all that at once! It would be so much easier to just write it... by hand."
"I intend to write a very important novel, young boy."
"Of course I'm ready, <span class="apelidoVermelho personagem">Knipe</span>."
"Oh, it sure was hard work, my boy."
"Oh <span class="apelidoVermelho personagem">Knipe</span>, let me see it. How does it read?"
"Good heavens, <span class="apelidoVermelho personagem">Knipe</span>? What's this?"
"But look here, my boy! It's outrageous!"
"Fruity?! This is definitely not the novel I was expecting to get! I can't put my name around this!"
"<span class="apelidoVermelho personagem">Knipe</span>! Is this some nasty trick you've been playing on me?"
"Oh, it certainly looks like some naughty trick of yours..."
"My dear boy, how should I know? My feet aren't what they used to be!"
"Don't know what you mean, my boy. You can't just go up to writers and suck them in!"
"Careful now, <span class="apelidoVermelho personagem">Knipe</span>, let's not get too frisky."
"Oh, they'll never agree to that..."
"What about that... urge you had? The creative urge, of course!"
"I like that, <span class="apelidoVermelho personagem">Knipe</span>. Nice work."
"Why is that?"
"Then why?"
