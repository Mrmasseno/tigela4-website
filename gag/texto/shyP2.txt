"<span class="apelidoVermelho personagem">Knipe</span>, my boy. I wanted to congratulate you."
"Aren't you pleased?"
"Did you read this morning's papers?"
"Aren't you pleased...?" 
"I really think you did good job <span class="apelidoVermelho personagem">Knipe</span>... Without you this project would still be in the drawing boards."
"Do you want to say something <span class="apelidoVermelho personagem">Knipe</span>?"
"Do you think you need some days off?."
"Maybe it's better if you take a holiday" 
"Take one or two weeks... Whatever you like, it's up to you."
"Oh <span class="apelidoVermelho personagem">Knipe</span>, you came back already."
"How have you been?"
"Oh I don't know about that <span class="apelidoVermelho personagem">Knipe</span>..."
"I'm really not sure..."
"Your idea,"
"is very ambitious, <span class="apelidoVermelho personagem">Knipe</span>. But maybe you shouldn't take it too seriously. What possible use can it be to us? Who would want a machine for writing stories? Would it really be worth it?"
"Sure."
"Go ahead."
"Are you sure you want to trust me with that?" 
"A writer? I..."
"Are you really sure about what you're doing?"
"What sort of urge?"
"And what you do with these stories?" 
"I can see quite well how you feel, my boy." His voice was dripping with sympathy. "We all go through it one time or another in our lives. But given your responses do really think it's worth to keep going? Maybe you should just forget about it?"
"Wait a minute…"
"But what does this have to do with your machine...?"
"Please calm down..."
"I still dont get the point of it?"
"My dear boy, it can't possibly be a commercial proposition – ever. You know as well as I do
what it costs to build one of these machines."
"What do they pay?"
"That seems outrageous..."
"Oh.. I didn't know that... Writers must all make a lot of money then..."
"This doesn't seem right..."
"I still think it's impracticable, <span class="apelidoVermelho personagem">Knipe</span>."
"But seriously now, <span class="apelidoVermelho personagem">Knipe</span>. D"you really think they'd buy them?"
"And how will you sell them? Who will you say has written them?"
"I don't know, <span class="apelidoVermelho personagem">Knipe</span>. What really a good thing to do?"
"That's really ambitious..."
"I don't know <span class="apelidoVermelho personagem">Knipe</span>... Should I do that?"
"A writer, eh?"
"That would impress a lot of people..."
"One thing I don't quite understand, <span class="apelidoVermelho personagem">Knipe</span>. Where do the plots come from? The machine can't possibly invent plots."
"Go on."
"Where?"
"What we'll have to do, <span class="apelidoVermelho personagem">Knipe</span>, is to say that we're merely building another mathematical calculator, but of a new type. That'll keep the secret."
"Oh my god <span class="apelidoVermelho personagem">Knipe</span>, I have no idea how to work this..." said Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span> with an insecure face.
"Okay <span class="apelidoVermelho personagem">Knipe</span>..."
"I don't think this will work..."
"I'm really not sure about this,"
"I'm really not sure..."
"But where's the rest?"
"It stopped already..."
"Just seems like gibberish to me..."
"It just seems sloppy..."
"Maybe I should do a novel,"
"I want to do a novel..."
"Everyone tells me I ought to do a novel...,"
"All sorts of publishers are chasing after me day and night begging me to stop fooling around with stories and do something really important instead. A novel's the only thing that counts – that's what they say..."
"I really want this to be a good story <span class="apelidoVermelho personagem">Knipe</span>..., I've been noticing that the one's that you put my name on happen to be the most lackluster ones... Now people think that I'm a monkey..."
"I feel like you"ve been keeping the best ones for yourself <span class="apelidoVermelho personagem">Knipe</span>..."
"Please make sure that the book that comes out next time is a good one please..."
"<span class="apelidoVermelho personagem">Knipe</span>, it don't really think I'll be able to do that..."
"I wanted to write an important novel..."
"Im not sure..."
"It sure was hard work..."
"Let me see it, <span class="apelidoVermelho personagem">Knipe</span>. How does it read?"
"This doesn't look promissing <span class="apelidoVermelho personagem">Knipe</span>..." Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>'s thin purple fish-lip was moving slightly as it mouthed the words, his face looked really sad.
"I don't know <span class="apelidoVermelho personagem">Knipe</span>... This looks bad..."
"Fruity? This seems really innapropriate, I can't possibly put my name to this..."
"Are you trying to pull a trick on me <span class="apelidoVermelho personagem">Knipe</span>...?"
"I don't know... I'm Sorry <span class="apelidoVermelho personagem">Knipe</span>..."
"I don't know... I'm not really sure..."
"Don't know what you mean...You can't just absorb writers..."
"Be careful <span class="apelidoVermelho personagem">Knipe</span>..."
"I don't think they would agree..."
"What about the creative urge, <span class="apelidoVermelho personagem">Knipe</span>...?"
"Nice work..."
"Why?"
"Then why?"
