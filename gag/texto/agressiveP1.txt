"No! I am not!"
"No I didn't. You're getting on my nerves already with your chit chat."
"Yeah sure whatever."
"No! What are you talking about?!"
"Oh, finally. I thought I would never take a brake from this god forsaken place!"
"Yeah sure, bye!"
"Of course,"
"it's completely ridiculous."
"It's a delicious idea, but so impracticable it doesn't really bear thinking about at all."
"Look, Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>!"
"Look at these!"
"It works Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>, who do you think you're talking to?"
"I gonna sit here."
"I'm gonna explain to you, Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>, how I did this."
"Are you listening now? I can never tell when you're really listening because you seem dead most of the time!"
"You see, Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>, I don't really care for my work here. I know I'm good at it and all that sort of thing. But your presence is killing me everyday, so I'm trying to do something else."
"I'm gonna be a writer Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>."
"I've spent all my time outside of this depressing office writing stories. In the last ten years I've written hundreds, literally hundreds of short stories. Five hundred and sixty-six, to be precise. Approximately one a week."
"Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>, I have the urge!"
"The creative urge."
"That's the god damned catch. None of those dirt heads will buy them. Each time I finish one, I send it out on the rounds. It goes to one magazine after another. That's all that happens, Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>, and they simply send them back. It's really pissing me off."
"My stories are amazing, these magazines just don't know what really a quality story is."
"Do you even read the magazines Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>? I bet you do, just not the ones I'm trying to get into."
"My machine will write stories by itself with just the push of a couple buttons, AND will write them acording to whatever the magazines are rambling about."
"Shut up and listen already."
"So you see, on my machine, by having an adjustable coordinator between the 'plot-memory' section and the 'word-memory' section I am able to produce any type of story I desire simply by pressing the required button."
"If you think about it, we will actually be able to produce how many stories we want in a matter of seconds, how are you not seeing the business oportunity in this? You dusty Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>?"
"You don't even know how much these magazines pay for a single story, dusty Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>."
"Anything up to twenty-five hundred dollars. It probably averages around a thousand."
"It's true you rusty head."
"Well know you're getting on my nerves."
"The big magazines are carrying approximately three fiction stories in each issue. Now, take the fifteen most important magazines – the ones paying the most money. A few of them are monthlies, but most of them come out every week. All right. That makes, let us say, around forty big stories being bought each week. That's forty thousand dollars. So with our machine – when we get it working properly – we can collar nearly the whole of this market."
"No. With volume alone we'll completely overwhelm them... This machine can produce a five-thousand-word story, all typed and ready for dispatch, in thirty seconds. Are you even awake at this point?"
"Nowadays, Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>, the hand-made article hasn't a hope. It can't possibly compete with massproduction, especially in this country – you know that. Knives … guns … shoes … bricks … crockery … anything you like to mention – they're all made by machinery now. The quality may be inferior, but that doesn't matter. It's the cost of production that counts. And stories – well – they're just another product, like knives and guns, and no one cares how you produce them so long as you deliver the goods. We'll sell them wholesale, Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>! We'll undercut every writer in the country! We'll corner the market!"
"Forty thousand a week..."
"And if we halve the price, making it twenty thousand a week, that's still a million a year."
"That's more than your stupid calculator will ever make! "
"People don't give a donkey's bum about custom made stories, all they care about is profit!"
"We'll set up our own literary agency, and we'll distribute them through that. And we'll invent all the names we want for the writers."
"And another thing, Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>. There's all manner of valuable by-products once you've got started. Take advertising, for example. Beer manufacturers and people like that are willing to pay good money these days if famous writers will lend their names to their products.You're so old and obsolete that you don't understand basic current marketing."
"Will you shut up if we just put your name in some insignificant little stupid story?"
"Some writers get to be very much respected - unlike you, Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>, you're past your expiration date, and the only thing that could ever give you a glimpse of respect would be for you to fake writing a story!
"Exactly you old shoe head, know you're starting to get it!"
"We feed those in, Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>. There's three or four hundred of them written down in that folder there on your left. Feed them straight into the 'plot-memory' section of the machine."
"There are many other little refinements too, Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>. You'll see them all when you study the plans carefully. For example, there's a trick that nearly every writer uses, of inserting at least one long, obscure word into each story. This makes the reader think that the man is very wise and clever. Just like people might say that you're wise and clever, they're really lying Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>."
"In the 'word-memory' section,"
"Exacly... See Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>, when you really take your time to think of something clever, sometimes you spit out a little idea."
"Which button?"
"Just pick something already Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>."
"Right now Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>,"
"you might seem more intelegent than you really are, but don't get carried away by my genius. "
"Ok this might do the job."
"If this doesn't work, I'm gonna punch my own face so hard!"
"So much for the selection,"
"That's it  Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>"
"There's your story!"
"Shut up, it's probably just a loose cable somewhere."
"What do you about anything Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>?"
"How is it broken you foot face, it's suposed to be short."
"It's just not breaking up the words, this is a simple adjustment." 
"See Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>? You better apologize!"
"No! You're sloppy Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>!"
"Yeah yeah, shut up already."
"We're going to do novels,"
"But shut please shut up for a minute."
"You make a monkey out of yourself, not me!"
"I thought about doing, I just pity your insignificance."
"With the sort of switchboard I'm rigging up, you'll be able to write any sort ofbook."
"How would you write anything that's not your name Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>?"
"Yeah yeah, whatever."
"Ok, watch this."
"Here you go Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>."
"Am I a joke to you?"
"Fruity? Seems something of your manner to be honest."
"Sure, whatever."
"No you're just daft."
"You don't even know how to work this baby grade machine and you're blaming me?"
"Just try again..."
"See here, Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>,"
"We still got too much competition...We need to get rid of them."
"Oh really? Just watch me!."
"I've got a list here, of fifty of the most successful writers in the country, and what I intend to do is offer each one of them a lifetime contract with pay. All they have to do is undertake never to write another word; and, of course, to let us use their names on our own stuff."
"You watch and learn Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>."
"To hell with that!"
"Madam,"
"Come with me."
"All right,"
"you want to do a book now?"
"That's one of them out of the way..."
"A pretty big one too."
"And you know why she signed?
"It wasn't the money..."
"Simply because the machine stuff was better than her own little stories."
