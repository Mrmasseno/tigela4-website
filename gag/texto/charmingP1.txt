"Oh... I am, Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>."
"I haven't, sir, but I sure will after this."
"Oh, of course I am, Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>"
"Oh Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>... There's a lot of things in my mind right now... What do you specifically mean?"
"Oh, thank you Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>, but I'm not really sure... I really love being here..."
"Maybe you're right Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>, I think I'll accept your offer."
"Of course,"
"it's completely ridiculous."
"It's a delicious idea, but so impracticable it doesn't really bear thinking about at all."
"Oh yes Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>, It was really relaxing... But will you please, take a look at this?"
"But this will work Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>... I swear!"
"Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>, may I please sit down ?"
"I would like to explain something, Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>, if I may, about how I came to do all this."
"It's a sort of confession, I suppose, Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>. I think it explains why I've always been so… so kind of worried."
"You see, Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>, I don't really know how to say this but... I don't really care much for my work here. I know I'm good at it and all that sort of thing, but my heart's not in it. It's not what I really the most."
"You see, sir, all my life I've wanted to be a writer."
"Yes, Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>. You may not believe it, but every bit of spare time I've had, I've spent writing stories. I got have a lot of them already, like a lot... A big stack of stories."
"Oh, All I know, Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>, is I have the urge."
"Oh, you silly. The creative urge, Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>."
"Huh, sir, that's the... Hard part. No one will buy them. Each time I finish one, I send it out on the rounds. It goes to one magazine after another. That's all that happens, Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>, and they simply send them back, and it's really making me sad."
"That's not true Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>... I know my stories are good, especially when you compare them to the boring stuff the magazines publish."
"What sort of magazines do usually read Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>?"
"Everything, Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>. What I want to tell you is, I've made a study of magazines, all sorts of magazines, and it seems that each one tends to have its own particular type of story. The writers – the successful ones – know this, and they write accordingly."
"Please, Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>, just hear me through..."
"So you see, Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>, on my machine, by having an adjustable coordinator between the 'plot-memory' section and the 'word-memory' section I am able to produce any type of story I desire simply by pressing the required button."
"The market is limited Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>. We've got to be able to produce the right stuff, at the right time, whenever we want it. It's a matter of business, that's all. I just trying to look at it from your perspective sir..."
"Yes, Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>, I do. But with due respect, you need to see how much the magazines pay writers for stories..."
"Oh, they pay a lot Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>, anything up to twenty-five hundred dollars..."
"Believe me Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>!"
"It's not sir! It's really true Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>..."
"That's exactly it, Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>... I've got it all worked out... The big magazines are carrying approximately three fiction stories in each issue. Now, take the fifteen most important magazines – the ones paying the most money. A few of them are monthlies, but most of them come out every week. All right. That makes, let us say, around forty big stories being bought each week. That's forty thousand dollars. So with our machine – when we get it working properly – we can collar nearly the whole of this market."
"Honestly, Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>, it's true what I say. With volume alone we'll completely overwhelm them... This machine can produce a five-thousand-word story, all typed and ready for dispatch, in thirty seconds. Tell me now Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>, how will they ever compete with us?"
"Nowadays, Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>, the hand-made article hasn't a hope. It can't possibly compete with massproduction, especially in this country – you know that. Carpets … chairs … shoes … bricks … crockery … anything you like to mention – they're all made by machinery now. The quality may be inferior, but that doesn't matter. It's the cost of production that counts. And stories – well – they're just another product, like carpets and chairs, and no one cares how you produce them so long as you deliver the goods. We'll sell them wholesale, Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>! We'll undercut every writer in the country! We can do this Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>, I believe it!"
"Forty thousand a week..."
"And if we halve the price, making it twenty thousand a week, that's still a million a year."
"I think that's more than what we would make from building dusty old electric calculator, don't you think Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>?"
"I know that people in general would probably value more custom writen stories, but from a momey making point of view, they would probably choose the ones that are half the price anyway..."
"We'll set up our own literary agency, and we'll distribute them through that. And we'll invent all
the names we want for the writers."
"It is sort of naughty, Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>. There's all manner of valuable by-products once you've got started. Take advertising, for example. Beer manufacturers and people like that are willing to pay good money these days if famous writers will lend their names to their products. I know this might seem a bit too much for now... But I really think there's chemistry."
"But Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>, what do you think about we putting your name in some of the stories huh?"
"Writers these days... they get a all lot of... respect. Like Mr Erle Gardner or Kathleen Morris, for example. And I really think you would be a great addition sir. Me and you... we could be a team."
"Oh yes Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>, in the good magazines!"
"Everyone has plots Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>, ones certainly better than the others, we'll just feed them straight into the 'plot-memory' section of the machine, and voila!"
"There are many other little refinements too, Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>. You'll see them all when you study the plans carefully. For example, there's a trick that nearly every writer uses, of inserting at least one long, obscure word into each story. This makes the reader think that the man is very wise and clever, just like you sir... So I have the machine do the same thing..."
"In the 'word-memory' section,"
"Which button?"
"I like that idea sir! We're soo naughty!"
"You choose sir, there's a lot to pick from... Just don't pick anything unorthodox!"
"Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>,"
"Do you realise, with just the touch of a button, how much power you have right now..?"
"So much for the selection,"
"Ok sir... Let's do this."
"Now here we go Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>! I'm so excited!"
"That's it!"
"Right there!"
"It 's alright sir, this happens sometimes...there's no shame in it!"
"Don't worry sir, just be patient."
"It really hasn't sir, it's suposed to be short!"
"Do not worry Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>, it's just not breaking up the words. That's an easy adjustment..." 
"It's tremendous, Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>! It's exactly right!"
"I think it's good..."
"And so you will, sir. It's just that this is a very complicated adjustment I have to make..."
"We're going to do novels,"
"Just as many as we want..."
"Right now, sir, you're not a monkey!"
"Oh no Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>! You got it all wrong!"
"Don't worry now sir, because with this new rig and setting up, you'll be able to do anything you want... writing wise of course, you silly!"
"You'll soon get used to it, Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>, I promise you. In a week or two, you'll be doing it without any hard work. It's just like learning to ride a bicycle!"
"And so you will sir!"
"Are you ready, Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>?"
"Now we're finished Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>."
"But you got it done sir, you really did it!"
"I must say it's a bit fruity sir..."
"Maybe you're right sir."
"Oh no, sir! No!"
"Maybe you just pressed a little too hard on the passion pedals Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>."
See here, Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>,
"Why don't we try this again?"
"We still got too much competition... We need to absorb all the other writers Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>."
"Of course you can sir! Exactly like Rockefeller did with his oil companies. Simply buy 'em out, and if they won't sell, squeeze 'em out."
"I've got a list here Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>, of fifty of the most successful writers in the country, and what I intend to do each one of them is make them an offer. All they have to do is undertake never to write another word; and, of course, to let us use their names on our own stuff."
"Oh Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>, You don't know writers. Writers are only interested in one thing..."
"I know for a fact that all they're really interested in is the money – just like everybody else, and like you Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>!"
"Madam,"
"Come with me and see it with your own eyes. My car awaits you."
"All right,"
"you want to do a book now?"
"That's one of them out of the way,"
"A pretty big one too."
"And do you wanna know why she did it?
"It wasn't the money, Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>..."
"Simply because she saw that our machine stuff was better than her own stuff."
