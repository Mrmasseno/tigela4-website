<span class="dialogoAzul">"Well, <span class="apelidoVermelho personagem">Knipe</span>, my boy. Now that it's finished, I just called you in to tell you I think you've done a fine job."</span><br>
<span id="vermelho" class="nomeVermelho personagem">Adolph Knipe</span> stood still in front of Mr <span id="azul" class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span></span>'s desk. There seemed to be no enthusiasm in him at all.<br>
<span class="dialogoAzul">"Aren't you pleased?"</span><br>
<span class="dialogoVermelho">"Oh yes, Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>."</span><br>
<span class="dialogoAzul">"Did you see what the papers said this morning?"</span><br>
<span class="dialogoVermelho">"No, sir, I didn't."</span><br>
The man behind the desk pulled a folded newspaper towards him, and began to read: ‘The building of the great automatic computing engine, ordered by the government some time ago, is now complete. It is probably the fastest electronic calculating machine in the world today. Its function is to satisfy the ever-increasing need of science, industry, and administration for rapid mathematical calculation which, in the past, by traditional methods, would have been physically impossible, or would have required more time than the problems justified. The speed with which the new engine works, said Mr <span class="nomeAzul personagem">John Bohlen</span>, head of the firm of electrical engineers mainly responsible for its construction, may be grasped by the fact that it can provide the correct answer in five seconds to a problem that would occupy a mathematician for a month. In three minutes, it can produce a calculation that by hand (if it were possible) would fill half a million sheets of foolscap paper. The automatic computing engine uses pulses of electricity, generated at the rate of a million a second, to solve all calculations that resolve themselves into addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. For practical purposes there is no limit to what it can do ...'<br>
Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span> glanced up at the long, melancholy face of the younger man.<br>
<span class="dialogoAzul">"Aren't you proud, <span class="apelidoVermelho personagem">Knipe</span>? Aren't you pleased?"</span><br>
<span class="dialogoVermelho">"Of course, Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>."</span><br>
<span class="dialogoAzul">"I don't think I have to remind you that your own contribution, especially to the original plans, was an important one. In fact, I might go so far as to say that without you and some of your ideas, this project might still be on the drawing-boards today."</span><br>
<span class="nomeVermelho personagem">Adolph Knipe</span> moved his feet on the carpet, and he watched the two small white hands of his chief, the nervous fingers playing with a paperclip, unbending it, straightening out the hairpin curves. He didn't like the man's hands. He didn't like his face either, with the tiny mouth and the narrow purple- coloured lips. It was unpleasant the way only the lower lip moved when he talked.<br>
<span class="dialogoAzul">"Is anything bothering you, <span class="apelidoVermelho personagem">Knipe?</span> Anything on your mind?"</span><br>
<span class="dialogoVermelho">"Oh no, Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>. No."</span><br>
<span class="dialogoAzul">"How would you like to take a week's holiday? Do you good. You've earned it."</span><br>
<span class="dialogoVermelho">"Oh, I don't know, sir."</span><br>
The older man waited, watching this tall, thin person who stood so sloppily before him. He was a difficult boy. Why couldn't he stand up straight? Always drooping and untidy, with spots on his jacket, and hair falling all over his face.<br>
<span class="dialogoAzul">"I'd like you to take a holiday, <span class="apelidoVermelho personagem">Knipe</span>. You need it."</span><br>
<span class="dialogoVermelho">"All right, sir. If you wish."</span><br>
<span class="dialogoAzul">"Take a week. Two weeks if you like. Go somewhere warm. Get some sunshine. Swim. Relax. Sleep. Then come back, and we'll have another talk about the future."</span><br>
<span class="nomeVermelho personagem">Adolph Knipe</span> went home by bus to his two-room apartment. He threw his coat on the sofa, poured himself a drink of whisky, and sat down in front of the typewriter that was on the table. Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span> was right. Of course he was right. Except that he didn't know the half of it. He probably thought it was a woman. Whenever a young man gets depressed, everybody thinks it's a woman.<br>
He leaned forward and began to read through the half-finished sheet of typing still in the machine. It was headed ‘A Narrow Escape', and it began ‘The night was dark and stormy, the wind whistled in the trees, the rain poured down like cats and dogs ...'<br>
<span class="nomeVermelho personagem">Adolph Knipe</span> took a sip of whisky, tasting the malty-bitter flavour, feeling the trickle of cold liquid as it travelled down his throat and settled in the top of his stomach, cool at first, then spreading and becoming warm, making a little area of warmness in the gut. To hell with Mr <span class="nomeAzul personagem">John Bohlen</span> anyway. And to hell with the great electrical computing machine. To hell with …<br>
At exactly that moment, his eyes and mouth began slowly to open, in a sort of wonder, and slowly he raised his head and became still, absolutely motionless, gazing at the wall opposite with this look that was more perhaps of astonishment than of wonder, but quite fixed now, unmoving, and remaining thus for forty, fifty, sixty seconds. Then gradually (the head still motionless), a subtle change spreading over the face, astonishment becoming pleasure, very slight at first, only around the corners of the mouth, increasing gradually, spreading out until at last the whole face was open wide and shining with extreme delight. It was the first time <span class="nomeVermelho personagem">Adolph Knipe</span> had smiled in many, many months.<br>
<span class="dialogoVermelho">"Of course,"</span> he said, speaking aloud, <span class="dialogoVermelho">"it's completely ridiculous."</span><br>
Again he smiled, raising his upper lip and baring his teeth in a queerly sensual manner.<br>
<span class="dialogoVermelho">"It's a delicious idea, but so impracticable it doesn't really bear thinking about at all."</span><br>
From then on, <span class="nomeVermelho personagem">Adolph Knipe</span> began to think about nothing else. The idea fascinated him enormously, at first because it gave him a promise – however remote – of revenging himself in a most devilish manner upon his greatest enemies. From this angle alone, he toyed idly with it for perhaps ten or fifteen minutes; then all at once he found himself examining it quite seriously as a practical possibility. He took paper and made some preliminary notes. But he didn't get far. He found himself, almost immediately, up against the old truth that a machine, however ingenious, is incapable of original thought. It can handle no problems except those that resolve themselves into mathematical terms – problems that contain one, and only one, correct answer.
This was a stumper. There didn't seem any way around it. A machine cannot have a brain. On the other hand, it can have a memory, can it not? Their own electronic calculator had a marvellous memory. Simply by converting electric pulses, through a column of mercury, into supersonic waves, it could store away at least a thousand numbers at a time, extracting any one of them at the precise moment it was needed. Would it not be possible, therefore, on this principle, to build a memory section of almost unlimited size? Now what about that?
Then suddenly, he was struck by a powerful but simple little truth, and it was this: that English grammar is governed by rules that are almost mathematical in their strictness! Given the words, and given the sense of what is to be said, then there is only one correct order in which those words can be arranged.
No, he thought, that isn't quite accurate. In many sentences there are several alternative positions for words and phrases, all of which may be grammatically correct. But what the hell. The theory itself is basically true. Therefore, it stands to reason that an engine built along the lines of the electric computer could be adjusted to arrange words (instead of numbers) in their right order according to the rules of grammar. Give it the verbs, the nouns, the adjectives, the pronouns, store them in the memory section as a vocabulary, and arrange for them to be extracted as required. Then feed it with plots and leave it to write the sentences.
There was no stopping <span class="apelidoVermelho personagem">Knipe</span> now. He went to work immediately, and there followed during the next few days a period of intense labour. The living-room became littered with sheets of paper: formulae and calculations; lists of words, thousands and thousands of words; the plots of stories, curiously broken up and subspanided; huge extracts from Roget's Thesaurus; pages filled with the first names of men and women; hundreds of surnames taken from the telephone directory; intricate drawings of wires and circuits and switches and thermionic valves; drawings of machines that could punch holes of different shapes in little cards, and of a strange electric typewriter that could type ten thousand words a minute. Also a kind of control panel with a series of small push-buttons, each one labelled with the name of a famous American magazine.
He was working in a mood of exultation, prowling around the room amidst this littering of paper, rubbing his hands together, talking out loud to himself; and sometimes, with a sly curl of the nose he would mutter a series of murderous imprecations in which the word ‘editor' seemed always to be present. On the fifteenth day of continuous work, he collected the papers into two large folders which he carried – almost at a run – to the offices of <span class="nomeAzul personagem">John Bohlen</span> Inc., electrical engineers.<br>
Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span> was pleased to see him back.<br>
<span class="dialogoAzul">"Well, <span class="apelidoVermelho personagem">Knipe</span>, good gracious me, you look a hundred per cent better. You have a good holiday? Where'd you go?"</span><br>
He's just as ugly and untidy as ever, Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span> thought. Why doesn't he stand up straight? He looks like a bent stick. <br>
<span class="dialogoAzul">"You look a hundred per cent better, my boy."</span><br>
I wonder what he's grinning about. Every time I see him, his ears seem to have got larger.<br>
<span class="nomeVermelho personagem">Adolph Knipe</span> placed the folders on the desk. <br>
<span class="dialogoVermelho">"Look, Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>!"</span> he cried. <span class="dialogoVermelho">"Look at these!" </span><br>
Then he poured out his story. He opened the folders and pushed the plans in front of the astonished little man. He talked for over an hour, explaining everything, and when he had finished, he stepped back, breathless, flushed, waiting for the verdict.<br>
<span class="dialogoAzul">"You know what I think, <span class="apelidoVermelho personagem">Knipe</span>? I think you're nuts."</span><br>
 Careful now, Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span> told himself. Treat him carefully. He's valuable, this one is. If only he didn't look so awful, with that long horse face and the big teeth. The fellow had ears as big as rhubarb leaves.<br>
<span class="dialogoVermelho">"But Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>! It'll work! I've proved to you it'll work! You can't deny that!"</span><br>
<span class="dialogoAzul">"Take it easy now, <span class="apelidoVermelho personagem">Knipe</span>. Take it easy, and listen to me."</span><br>
<span class="nomeVermelho personagem">Adolph Knipe</span> watched his man, disliking him more every second.<br>
<span class="dialogoAzul">"This idea,"</span> Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>'s lower lip was saying, <span class="dialogoAzul">"is very ingenious – I might almost say brilliant – and it only goes to confirm my opinion of your abilities, <span class="apelidoVermelho personagem">Knipe</span>. But don't take it too seriously. After all, my boy, what possible use can it be to us? Who on earth wants a machine for writing stories? And where's the money in it, anyway? Just tell me that."</span><br>
<span class="dialogoVermelho">"May I sit down, sir?"</span><br>
<span class="dialogoAzul">"Sure, take a seat."</span><br>
<span class="nomeVermelho personagem">Adolph Knipe</span> seated himself on the edge of a chair. The older man watched him with alert brown eyes, wondering what was coming now.<br>
<span class="dialogoVermelho">"I would like to explain something, Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>, if I may, about how I came to do all this."</span><br>
<span class="dialogoAzul">"Go right ahead, <span class="apelidoVermelho personagem">Knipe</span>."</span><br>
He would have to be humoured a little now, Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span> told himself. The boy was really valuable – a sort of genius, almost – worth his weight in gold to the firm. Just look at these papers here. Darndest thing you ever saw. Astonishing piece of work. Quite useless, of course. No commercial value. But it proved again the boy's ability.<br>
<span class="dialogoVermelho">"It's a sort of confession, I suppose, Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>. I think it explains why I've always been so ... so kind of worried."</span><br>
<span class="dialogoAzul">"You tell me anything you want, <span class="apelidoVermelho personagem">Knipe</span>. I'm here to help you – you know that."</span><br>
The young man clasped his hands together tight on his lap, hugging himself with his elbows. It seemed as though suddenly he was feeling very cold.<br>
<span class="dialogoVermelho">"You see, Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>, to tell the honest truth, I don't really care much for my work here. I know I'm good at it and all that sort of thing, but my heart's not in it. It's not what I want to do most."</span> Up went Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>'s eyebrows, quick like a spring. His whole body became very still. <span class="dialogoVermelho">"You see, sir, all my life I've wanted to be a writer."</span><br>
<span class="dialogoAzul">"A writer!"</span><br>
<span class="dialogoVermelho">"Yes, Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>. You may not believe it, but every bit of spare time I've had, I've spent writing stories. In the last ten years I've written hundreds, literally hundreds of short stories. Five hundred and sixty-six, to be precise. Approximately one a week."</span><br>
<span class="dialogoAzul">"Good heavens, man! What on earth did you do that for?"</span><br>
<span class="dialogoVermelho">"All I know, sir, is I have the urge."</span><br>
<span class="dialogoAzul">"What sort of urge?"</span><br>
<span class="dialogoVermelho">"The creative urge, Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>."</span> Every time he looked up he saw Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>'s lips. They were growing thinner and thinner, more and more purple.<br>
<span class="dialogoAzul">"And may I ask you what you do with these stories, <span class="apelidoVermelho personagem">Knipe</span>?"</span><br>
<span class="dialogoVermelho">"Well, sir, that's the trouble. No one will buy them. Each time I finish one, I send it out on the rounds. It goes to one magazine after another. That's all that happens, Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>, and they simply send them back. It's very depressing."</span><br>
Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span> relaxed.<br>
<span class="dialogoAzul">"I can see quite well how you feel, my boy."</span><br>
 His voice was dripping with sympathy.<br>
<span class="dialogoAzul">"We all go through it one time or another in our lives. But now – now that you've had proof – positive proof – from the experts themselves, from the editors, that your stories are – what shall I say – rather unsuccessful, it's time to leave off. Forget it, my boy. Just forget all about it."</span><br>
<span class="dialogoVermelho">"No, Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>! No! That's not true! I know my stories are good. My heavens, when you compare them with the stuff some of those magazines print – oh my word, Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>! – the sloppy, boring stuff that you see in the magazines week after week – why, it drives me mad!"</span><br>
<span class="dialogoAzul">"Now wait a minute, my boy ..."</span><br>
<span class="dialogoVermelho">"Do you ever read the magazines, Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>?"</span><br>
<span class="dialogoAzul">"You'll pardon me, <span class="apelidoVermelho personagem">Knipe</span>, but what's all this got to do with your machine?"</span><br>
<span class="dialogoVermelho">"Everything, Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>, absolutely everything! What I want to tell you is, I've made a study of magazines, and it seems that each one tends to have its own particular type of story. The writers – the successful ones – know this, and they write accordingly."</span><br>
<span class="dialogoAzul">"Just a minute, my boy. Calm yourself down, will you. I don't think all this is getting us anywhere."</span><br>
<span class="dialogoVermelho">"Please, Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>, hear me through. It's all terribly important."</span><br>
He paused to catch his breath. He was properly worked up now, throwing his hands around as he talked. The long, toothy face, with the big ears on either side, simply shone with enthusiasm, and there was an excess of saliva in his mouth which caused him to speak his words wet. <br>
<span class="dialogoVermelho">"So you see, on my machine, by having an adjustable co- ordinator between the 'plot-memory' section and the 'word-memory' section I am able to produce any type of story I desire simply by pressing the required button."</span><br>
<span class="dialogoAzul">"Yes, I know, <span class="apelidoVermelho personagem">Knipe</span>, I know. This is all very interesting, but what's the point of it?"</span><br>
<span class="dialogoVermelho">"Just this, Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>. The market is limited. We've got to be able to produce the right stuff, at the right time, whenever we want it. It's a matter of business, that's all. I'm looking at it from your point of view now – as a commercial proposition."</span><br>
<span class="dialogoAzul">"My dear boy, it can't possibly be a commercial proposition – ever. You know as well as I do what it costs to build one of these machines."</span><br>
<span class="dialogoVermelho">"Yes, sir, I do. But with due respect, I don't believe you know what the magazines pay writers for stories."</span><br>
<span class="dialogoAzul">"What do they pay?"</span><br>
<span class="dialogoVermelho">"Anything up to twenty-five hundred dollars. It probably averages around a thousand."</span><br>
Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span> jumped.<br>
<span class="dialogoVermelho">"Yes, sir, it's true."</span><br>
<span class="dialogoAzul">"Absolutely impossible, <span class="apelidoVermelho personagem">Knipe</span>! Ridiculous!"</span><br>
<span class="dialogoVermelho">"No, sir, it's true."</span><br>
<span class="dialogoAzul">"You mean to sit there and tell me that these magazines pay out money like that to a man for ... just for scribbling off a story! Good heavens, <span class="apelidoVermelho personagem">Knipe</span>! Whatever next! Writers must all be millionaires!"</span><br>
<span class="dialogoVermelho">"That's exactly it, Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>! That's where the machine comes in. Listen a minute, sir, while I tell you some more. I've got it all worked out. The big magazines are carrying approximately three fiction stories in each issue. Now, take the fifteen most important magazines – the ones paying the most money. A few of them are monthlies, but most of them come out every week. All right. That makes, let us say, around forty big stories being bought each week. That's forty thousand dollars. So with our machine – when we get it working properly – we can collar nearly the whole of this market!"</span><br>
<span class="dialogoAzul">"My dear boy, you're mad!"</span><br>
<span class="dialogoVermelho">"No, sir, honestly, it's true what I say. Don't you see that with volume alone we'll completely overwhelm them! This machine can produce a five-thousand-word story, all typed and ready for dispatch, in thirty seconds. How can the writers compete with that? I ask you, Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>, how?"</span><br>
At that point, <span class="nomeVermelho personagem">Adolph Knipe</span> noticed a slight change in the man's expression, an extra brightness in the eyes, the nostrils distending, the whole face becoming still, almost rigid. Quickly, he continued.<br>
<span class="dialogoVermelho">"Nowadays, Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>, the hand-made article hasn't a hope. It can't possibly compete with mass-production, especially in this country – you know that. Carpets... chairs... shoes... bricks... crockery... anything you like to mention – they're all made by machinery now. The quality may be inferior, but that doesn't matter. It's the cost of production that counts. And stories – well – they're just another product, like carpets and chairs, and no one cares how you produce them so long as you deliver the goods. We'll sell them wholesale, Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>! We'll undercut every writer in the country! We'll corner the market!"</span><br>
Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span> edged up straighter in his chair. He was leaning forward now, both elbows on the desk, the face alert, the small brown eyes resting on the speaker.<br>
<span class="dialogoAzul">"I still think it's impracticable, <span class="apelidoVermelho personagem">Knipe</span>."</span><br>
<span class="dialogoVermelho">"Forty thousand a week!"</span> cried <span class="nomeVermelho personagem">Adolph Knipe</span>. <span class="dialogoVermelho">"And if we halve the price, making it twenty thousand a week, that's still a million a year!"</span><br>
And softly he added, <span class="dialogoVermelho">"You didn't get any million a year for building the old electronic calculator, did you, Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>?"</span><br>
<span class="dialogoAzul">"But seriously now, <span class="apelidoVermelho personagem">Knipe</span>. D'you really think they'd buy them?"</span><br>
<span class="dialogoVermelho">"Listen, Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>. Who on earth is going to want custom-made stories when they can get the other kind at half the price? It stands to reason, doesn't it?"</span><br>
<span class="dialogoAzul">"And how will you sell them? Who will you say has written them?"</span><br>
<span class="dialogoVermelho">"We'll set up our own literary agency, and we'll distribute them through that. And we'll invent all the names we want for the writers."</span><br>
<span class="dialogoAzul">"I don't like it, <span class="apelidoVermelho personagem">Knipe</span>. To me, that smacks of trickery, does it not?"</span><br>
<span class="dialogoVermelho">"And another thing, Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>. There's all manner of valuable by-products once you've got started. Take advertising, for example. Beer manufacturers and people like that are willing to pay good money these days if famous writers will lend their names to their products. Why, my heavens, Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>! This isn't any children's plaything we're talking about. It's big business."</span><br>
<span class="dialogoAzul">"Don't get too ambitious, my boy."</span><br>
<span class="dialogoVermelho">"And another thing. There isn't any reason why we shouldn't put your name, Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>, on some of the better stories, if you wished it."</span><br>
<span class="dialogoAzul">"My goodness, <span class="apelidoVermelho personagem">Knipe</span>. What should I want that for?"</span><br>
<span class="dialogoVermelho">"I don't know, sir, except that some writers get to be very much respected – like Mr Erle Gardner or Kathleen Morris, for example. We've got to have names, and I was certainly thinking of using my own on one or two stories, just to help out."</span><br>
<span class="dialogoAzul">"A writer, eh?"</span> Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span> said, musing. <span class="dialogoAzul">"Well, it would surely surprise them over at the club when they saw my name in the magazines – the good magazines."</span><br>
<span class="dialogoVermelho">"That's right, Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>!"</span><br>
For a moment, a dreamy, faraway look came into Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>'s eyes, and he smiled. Then he stirred himself and began leafing through the plans that lay before him.<br>
<span class="dialogoAzul">"One thing I don't quite understand, <span class="apelidoVermelho personagem">Knipe</span>. Where do the plots come from? The machine can't possibly invent plots."</span><br>
<span class="dialogoVermelho">"We feed those in, sir. That's no problem at all. Everyone has plots. There's three or four hundred of them written down in that folder there on your left. Feed them straight into the 'plot-memory' section of the machine."</span><br>
<span class="dialogoAzul">"Go on."</span><br>
<span class="dialogoVermelho">"There are many other little refinements too, Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>. You'll see them all when you study the plans carefully. For example, there's a trick that nearly every writer uses, of inserting at least one long, obscure word into each story. This makes the reader think that the man is very wise and clever. So I have the machine do the same thing. There'll be a whole stack of long words stored away just for this purpose."</span><br>
<span class="dialogoAzul">"Where?"</span><br>
<span class="dialogoVermelho">"In the 'word-memory' section,"</span> he said, epexegetically.<br>
Through most of that day the two men discussed the possibilities of the new engine. In the end, Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span> said he would have to think about it some more. The next morning, he was quietly enthusiastic. Within a week, he was completely sold on the idea.<br>
<span class="dialogoAzul">"What we'll have to do, <span class="apelidoVermelho personagem">Knipe</span>, is to say that we're merely building another mathematical calculator, but of a new type. That'll keep the secret."</span><br>
<span class="dialogoVermelho">"Exactly, Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>."</span><br>
And in six months the machine was completed. It was housed in a separate brick building at the back of the premises, and now that it was ready for action, no one was allowed near it excepting Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span> and <span class="nomeVermelho personagem">Adolph Knipe</span>.<br>
It was an exciting moment when the two men – the one, short, plump, breviped – the other tall, thin and toothy – stood in the corridor before the control panel and got ready to run off the first story. All around them were walls spaniding up into many small corridors, and the walls were covered with wiring and plugs and switches and huge glass valves. They were both nervous, Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span> hopping from one foot to the other, quite unable to keep still.<br>
<span class="dialogoVermelho">"Which button?"</span> <span class="nomeVermelho personagem">Adolph Knipe</span> asked, eyeing a row of small white discs that resembled the keys of a typewriter. 
<span class="dialogoVermelho">"You choose, Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>. Lots of magazines to pick from – Saturday Evening Post, Collier's, Ladies' Home Journal – any one you like."</span><br>
<span class="dialogoAzul">"Goodness me, boy! How do I know?"</span><br>
He was jumping up and down like a man with hives.<br>
<span class="dialogoVermelho">"Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>,"</span> <span class="nomeVermelho personagem">Adolph Knipe</span> said gravely, <span class="dialogoVermelho">"do you realize that at this moment, with your little finger alone, you have it in your power to become the most versatile writer on this continent?"</span><br>
<span class="dialogoAzul">"Listen, <span class="apelidoVermelho personagem">Knipe</span>, just get on with it, will you please – and cut out the preliminaries."</span><br>
<span class="dialogoVermelho">"OK, Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>. Then we'll make it ... let me see – this one. How's that?"</span><br>
He extended one finger and pressed down a button with the name TODAY'S WOMAN printed across it in diminutive black type. There was a sharp click, and when he took his finger away, the button remained down, below the level of the others.<br>
<span class="dialogoVermelho">"So much for the selection,"</span> he said. <span class="dialogoVermelho">"Now – here we go!"</span> He reached up and pulled a switch on the panel. Immediately, the room was filled with a loud humming noise, and a crackling of electric sparks, and the jingle of many, tiny, quickly moving levers; and almost in the same instant, sheets of quarto paper began sliding out from a slot to the right of the control panel and dropping into a basket below. They came out quick, one sheet a second, and in less than half a minute it was all over. The sheets stopped coming.<br>
<span class="dialogoVermelho">"That's it!"</span> <span class="nomeVermelho personagem">Adolph Knipe</span> cried. <span class="dialogoVermelho">"There's your story!"</span><br>
They grabbed the sheets and began to read. The first one they picked up started as follows:<br>
<br>
<i>"Aifkjmbsaoegweztp-pl-nvoqudskigt&,-fuhpekanvbertyuio lkjhgfdsazxcvbnm, peru itrehdjkg mvnb, wmsuy ..."</i><br>
<br>
They looked at the others. The style was roughly similar in all of them. Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span> began to shout. The younger man tried to calm him down.<br>
<span class="dialogoVermelho">"It's all right, sir. Really it is. It only needs a little adjustment. We've got a connection wrong somewhere, that's all. You must remember, Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>, there's over a million feet of wiring in this room. You can't expect everything to be right first time"</span><br>
<span class="dialogoAzul">"It'll never work,"</span> Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span> said.<br>
<span class="dialogoVermelho">"Be patient, sir. Be patient"</span><br>
<span class="nomeVermelho personagem">Adolph Knipe</span> set out to discover the fault, and in four days' time he announced that all was ready for the next try.<br>
<span class="dialogoAzul">"It'll never work,"</span> Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span> said. <span class="dialogoAzul">"I know it'll never work."</span><br>
<span class="apelidoVermelho personagem">Knipe</span> smiled and pressed the selector button marked Reader's Digest. Then he pulled the switch, and again the strange, exciting, humming sound filled the room. One page of typescript flew out of the slot into the basket.<br>
<span class="dialogoAzul">"Where's the rest?"</span> Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span> cried. <span class="dialogoAzul">"It's stopped! It's gone wrong!"</span><br>
<span class="dialogoVermelho">"No sir, it hasn't. It's exactly right. It's for the Digest, don't you see?"</span><br>
This time it began. <br>
<br>
<i>"Fewpeopleyetknowthatarevolutionary-newcurehasbeendiscoveredwhichmaywell-bringpermanent-relieftosufferersofthemostdreadeddiseaseofourtime..."</i> And so on.<br>
<br>
<span class="dialogoAzul">"It's gibberish!"</span> Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span> shouted.<br>
<span class="dialogoVermelho">"No, sir, it's fine. Can't you see? It's simply that she's not breaking up the words. That's an easy adjustment. But the story's there. Look, Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>, look! It's all there except that the words are joined together."</span><br>
And indeed it was.<br>
On the next try a few days later, everything was perfect, even the punctuation. The first story they ran off, for a famous women's magazine, was a solid, plotty story of a boy who wanted to better himself with his rich employer. This boy arranged, so that story went, for a friend to hold up the rich man's daughter on a dark night when she was driving home. Then the boy himself, happening by, knocked the gun out of his friend's hand and rescued the girl. The girl was grateful. But the father was suspicious. He questioned the boy sharply. The boy broke down and confessed. Then the father, instead of kicking him out of the house, said that he admired the boy's resourcefulness. The girl admired his honesty – and his looks. The father promised him to be head of the Accounts Department. The girl married him.<br>
<span class="dialogoVermelho">"It's tremendous, Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>! It's exactly right!"</span><br>
<span class="dialogoAzul">"Seems a bit sloppy to me, my boy!"</span><br>
<span class="dialogoVermelho">"No, sir, it's a seller, a real seller!"</span><br>
In his excitement, <span class="nomeVermelho personagem">Adolph Knipe</span> promptly ran off six more stories in as many minutes. All of them – except one, which for some reason came out a trifle lewd – seemed entirely satisfactory.<br>
Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span> was now mollified. He agreed to set up a literary agency in an office downtown, and to put <span class="apelidoVermelho personagem">Knipe</span> in charge. In a couple of weeks, this was accomplished. Then <span class="apelidoVermelho personagem">Knipe</span> mailed out the first dozen stories. He put his own name to four of them, Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>'s to one, and for the others he simply invented names.<br>
Five of these stories were promptly accepted. The one with Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>'s name on it was turned down with a letter from the fiction editor saying, ‘This is a skilful job, but in our opinion it doesn't quite come off. We would like to see more of this writer's work ...' <span class="nomeVermelho personagem">Adolph Knipe</span> took a cab out to the factory and ran off another story for the same magazine. He again put Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>'s name to it, and mailed it immediately. That one they bought.<br>
The money started pouring in. <span class="apelidoVermelho personagem">Knipe</span> slowly and carefully stepped up the output, and in six months' time he was delivering thirty stories a week, and selling about half.<br>
He began to make a name for himself in literary circles as a prolific and successful writer. So did Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>; but not quite such a good name, although he didn't know it. At the same time, <span class="apelidoVermelho personagem">Knipe</span> was building up a dozen or more fictitious persons as promising young authors. Everything was going fine.<br>
At this point it was decided to adapt the machine for writing novels as well as stories. Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>, thirsting now for greater honours in the literary world, insisted that <span class="apelidoVermelho personagem">Knipe</span> go to work at once on this prodigious task.<br>
<span class="dialogoAzul">"I want to do a novel,"</span> he kept saying. <span class="dialogoAzul">"I want to do a novel."</span><br>
<span class="dialogoVermelho">"And so you will, sir. And so you will. But please be patient. This is a very complicated adjustment I have to make."</span><br>
<span class="dialogoAzul">"Everyone tells me I ought to do a novel,"</span> Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span> cried. <span class="dialogoAzul">"All sorts of publishers are chasing after me day and night begging me to stop fooling around with stories and do something really important instead. A novel's the only thing that counts – that's what they say."</span><br>
<span class="dialogoVermelho">"We're going to do novels,"</span> <span class="apelidoVermelho personagem">Knipe</span> told him. <span class="dialogoVermelho">"Just as many as we want. But please be patient."</span><br>
<span class="dialogoAzul">"Now listen to me, <span class="apelidoVermelho personagem">Knipe</span>. What I'm going to do is a serious novel, something that'll make 'em sit up and take notice. I've been getting rather tired of the sort of stories you've been putting my name to lately. As a matter of fact, I'm none too sure you haven't been trying to make a monkey out of me."</span><br>
<span class="dialogoVermelho">"A monkey, Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>?"</span><br>
<span class="dialogoAzul">"Keeping all the best ones for yourself, that's what you've been doing."</span><br>
<span class="dialogoVermelho">"Oh no, Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>! No!"</span><br>
<span class="dialogoAzul">"So this time I'm going to make damn sure I write a high class intelligent book. You understand that."</span><br>
<span class="dialogoVermelho">"Look, Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>. With the sort of switchboard I'm rigging up, you'll be able to write any sort of book you want."</span><br>
And this was true, for within another couple of months, the genius of <span class="nomeVermelho personagem">Adolph Knipe</span> had not only adapted the machine for novel writing, but had constructed a marvellous new control system which enabled the author to pre-select literally any type of plot and any style of writing he desired. There were so many dials and levers on the thing, it looked like the instrument panel of some enormous aeroplane.<br>
First, by depressing one of a series of master buttons, the writer made his primary decision: historical, satirical, philosophical, political, romantic, erotic, humorous, or straight. Then, from the second row (the basic buttons), he chose his theme: army life, pioneer days, civil war, world war, racial problem, wild west, country life, childhood memories, seafaring, the sea bottom and many, many more. The third row of buttons gave a choice of literary style: classical, whimsical, racy, Hemingway, Faulkner, Joyce, feminine, etc. The fourth row was for characters, the fifth for wordage – and so on and so on – ten long rows of pre-selector buttons.<br>
But that wasn't all. Control had also to be exercised during the actual writing process (which took about fifteen minutes per novel), and to do this the author had to sit, as it were, in the driver's seat, and pull (or push) a battery of labelled stops, as on an organ. By so doing, he was able continually to modulate or merge fifty different and variable qualities such as tension, surprise, humour, pathos, and mystery. Numerous dials and gauges on the dashboard itself told him throughout exactly how far along he was with his work.<br>
Finally, there was the question of ‘passion'. From a careful study of the books at the top of the best-seller lists for the past year, <span class="nomeVermelho personagem">Adolph Knipe</span> had decided that this was the most important ingredient of all – a magical catalyst that somehow or other could transform the dullest novel into a howling success – at any rate financially. But <span class="apelidoVermelho personagem">Knipe</span> also knew that passion was powerful, heady stuff, and must be prudently dispensed – the right proportions at the right moments; and to ensure this, he had devised an independent control consisting of two sensitive sliding adjustors operated by foot- pedals, similar to the throttle and brake in a car. One pedal governed the percentage of passion to be injected, the other regulated its intensity. There was no doubt, of course – and this was the only drawback – that the writing of a novel by the <span class="apelidoVermelho personagem">Knipe</span> methods was going to be rather like flying a plane and driving a car and playing an organ all at the same time, but this did not trouble the inventor. When all was ready, he proudly escorted Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span> into the machine house and began to explain the operating procedure for the new wonder.<br>
<span class="dialogoAzul">"Good God, <span class="apelidoVermelho personagem">Knipe</span>! I'll never be able to do all that! Dammit, man, it'd be easier to write the thing by hand!"</span><br>
<span class="dialogoVermelho">"You'll soon get used to it, Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>, I promise you. In a week or two, you'll be doing it without hardly thinking. It's just like learning to drive."</span><br>
Well, it wasn't quite as easy as that, but after many hours of practice, Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span> began to get the hang of it, and finally, late one evening, he told <span class="apelidoVermelho personagem">Knipe</span> to make ready for running off the first novel. It was a tense moment, with the fat little man crouching nervously in the driver's seat, and the tall toothy <span class="apelidoVermelho personagem">Knipe</span> fussing excitedly around him.<br>
<span class="dialogoAzul">"I intend to write an important novel, <span class="apelidoVermelho personagem">Knipe</span>."</span><br>
<span class="dialogoVermelho">"I'm sure you will, sir. I'm sure you will."</span><br>
With one finger, Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span> carefully pressed the necessary pre-selector buttons:<br>
<i>Master button – satirical</i><br>
<i>Subject – racial problem</i><br>
<i>Style – classical</i><br>
<i>Characters – six men, four women, one infant</i><br>
<i>Length – fifteen chapters.</i><br>
At the same time he had his eye particularly upon three organ stops marked power, mystery, profundity.<br>
<span class="dialogoVermelho">"Are you ready, sir?"</span><br>
<span class="dialogoAzul">"Yes, yes, I'm ready."</span><br>
<span class="apelidoVermelho personagem">Knipe</span> pulled the switch. The great engine hummed. There was a deep whirring sound from the oiled movement of fifty thousand cogs and rods and levers; then came the drumming of the rapid electrical typewriter, setting up a shrill, almost intolerable clatter. Out into the basket flew the typewritten pages – one every two seconds. But what with the noise and the excitement and having to play upon the stops, and watch the chapter-counter and the pace-indicator and the passion-gauge, Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span> began to panic. He reacted in precisely the way a learner driver does in a car – by pressing both feet hard down on the pedals and keeping them there until the thing stopped.<br>
<span class="dialogoVermelho">"Congratulations on your first novel,"</span> <span class="apelidoVermelho personagem">Knipe</span> said, picking up the great bundle of typed pages from the basket.
Little pearls of sweat were oozing out all over Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>'s face.<br>
<span class="dialogoAzul">"It sure was hard work, my boy."</span><br>
<span class="dialogoVermelho">"But you got it done, sir. You got it done."</span><br>
<span class="dialogoAzul">"Let me see it, <span class="apelidoVermelho personagem">Knipe</span>. How does it read?"</span><br>
He started to go through the first chapter, passing each finished page to the younger man.<br>
<span class="dialogoAzul">"Good heavens, <span class="apelidoVermelho personagem">Knipe</span>! What's this!"</span><br>
Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>'s thin purple fish-lip was moving slightly as it mouthed the words, his cheeks were beginning slowly to inflate.<br>
<span class="dialogoAzul">"But look here, <span class="apelidoVermelho personagem">Knipe</span>! This is outrageous!"</span><br>
<span class="dialogoVermelho">"I must say it's a bit fruity, sir."</span><br>
<span class="dialogoAzul">"Fruity! It's perfectly revolting! I can't possibly put my name to this!"</span><br>
<span class="dialogoVermelho">"Quite right, sir. Quite right!"</span><br>
<span class="dialogoAzul">"<span class="apelidoVermelho personagem">Knipe</span>! Is this some nasty trick you've been playing on me?"</span><br>
<span class="dialogoVermelho">"Oh no, sir! No!"</span><br>
<span class="dialogoAzul">"It certainly looks like it."</span><br>
<span class="dialogoVermelho">"You don't think, Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>, that you mightn't have been pressing a little hard on the passion-control pedals, do you?"</span><br>
<span class="dialogoAzul">"My dear boy, how should I know?"</span><br>
<span class="dialogoVermelho">"Why don't you try another?"</span><br>
So Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span> ran off a second novel, and this time it went according to plan.<br>
Within a week, the manuscript had been read and accepted by an enthusiastic publisher. <span class="apelidoVermelho personagem">Knipe</span> followed with one in his own name, then made a dozen more for good measure. In no time at all, <span class="nomeVermelho personagem">Adolph Knipe</span>'s Literary Agency had become famous for its large stable of promising young novelists. And once again the money started rolling in.<br>
It was at this stage that young <span class="apelidoVermelho personagem">Knipe</span> began to display a real talent for big business.<br>
<span class="dialogoVermelho">"See here, Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>,"</span> he said. <span class="dialogoVermelho">"We still got too much competition. Why don't we just absorb all the other writers in the country?"</span><br>
Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>, who now sported a bottle-green velvet jacket and allowed his hair to cover two-thirds of his ears, was quite content with things the way they were.<br>
<span class="dialogoAzul">"Don't know what you mean, my boy. You can't just absorb writers."</span><br>
<span class="dialogoVermelho">"Of course you can, sir. Exactly like Rockefeller did with his oil companies. Simply buy 'em out, and if they won't sell, squeeze 'em out. It's easy!"</span><br>
<span class="dialogoAzul">"Careful now, <span class="apelidoVermelho personagem">Knipe</span>. Be careful."</span><br>
<span class="dialogoVermelho">"I've got a list here sir, of fifty of the most successful writers in the country, and what I intend to do is offer each one of them a lifetime contract with pay. All they have to do is undertake never to write another word; and, of course, to let us use their names on our own stuff. How about that?"</span><br>
<span class="dialogoAzul">"They'll never agree."</span><br>
<span class="dialogoVermelho">"You don't know writers, Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>. You watch and see."</span><br>
<span class="dialogoAzul">"What about the creative urge, <span class="apelidoVermelho personagem">Knipe</span>?"</span><br>
<span class="dialogoVermelho">"It's bunk! All they're really interested in is the money – just like everybody else."</span><br>
In the end, Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span> reluctantly agreed to give it a try, and <span class="apelidoVermelho personagem">Knipe</span>, with his list of writers in his pocket, went off in a large chauffeur-driven Cadillac to make his calls.<br>
He journeyed first to the man at the top of the list, a very great and wonderful writer, and he had no trouble getting into the house. He told his story and produced a suitcase full of sample novels, and a contract for the man to sign which guaranteed him so much a year for life. The man listened politely, decided he was dealing with a lunatic, gave him a drink, then firmly showed him to the door.<br>
The second writer on the list, when he saw <span class="apelidoVermelho personagem">Knipe</span> was serious, actually attacked him with a large metal paperweight, and the inventor had to flee down the garden followed by such a torrent of abuse and obscenity as he had never heard before.<br>
But it took more than this to discourage <span class="nomeVermelho personagem">Adolph Knipe</span>. He was disappointed but not dismayed, and off he went in his big car to seek his next client. This one was a female, famous and popular, whose fat romantic books sold by the million across the country. She received <span class="apelidoVermelho personagem">Knipe</span> graciously, gave him tea, and listened attentively to his story.<br>
<b>"It all sounds very fascinating,"</b> she said. <b>"But of course I find it a little hard to believe."</b><br>
<span class="dialogoVermelho">"Madam,"</span> <span class="apelidoVermelho personagem">Knipe</span> answered. <span class="dialogoVermelho">"Come with me and see it with your own eyes. My car awaits you."</span><br>
So off they went, and in due course, the astonished lady was ushered into the machine house where the wonder was kept. Eagerly, <span class="apelidoVermelho personagem">Knipe</span> explained its workings, and after a while he even permitted her to sit in the driver's seat and practise with the buttons.<br>
<span class="dialogoVermelho">"All right,"</span> he said suddenly, <span class="dialogoVermelho">"you want to do a book now?"</span><br>
<b>"Oh yes!"</b> she cried. <b>"Please!"</b><br>
She was very competent and seemed to know exactly what she wanted. She made her own pre-selections, then ran off a long, romantic, passion-filled novel. She read through the first chapter and became so enthusiastic that she signed up on the spot.<br>
<span class="dialogoVermelho">"That's one of them out of the way,"</span> <span class="apelidoVermelho personagem">Knipe</span> said to Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span> afterwards.<br>
<span class="dialogoVermelho">"A pretty big one too."</span><br>
<span class="dialogoAzul">"Nice work, my boy."</span><br>
<span class="dialogoVermelho">"And you know why she signed?"</span><br>
<span class="dialogoAzul">"Why?"</span><br>
<span class="dialogoVermelho">"It wasn't the money. She's got plenty of that."</span><br>
<span class="dialogoAzul">"Then why?"</span><br>
<span class="apelidoVermelho personagem">Knipe</span> grinned, lifting his lip and baring a long pale upper gum.<br>
<span class="dialogoVermelho">"Simply because she saw the machine-made stuff was better than her own."</span><br>
Thereafter, <span class="apelidoVermelho personagem">Knipe</span> wisely decided to concentrate only upon mediocrity. Anything better than that – and there were so few it didn't matter much – was apparently not quite so easy to seduce.<br>
In the end, after several months of work, he had persuaded something like seventy per cent of the writers on his list to sign the contract. He found that the older ones, those who were running out of ideas and had taken to drink, were the easiest to handle. The younger people were more troublesome. They were apt to become abusive, sometimes violent when he approached them; and more than once <span class="apelidoVermelho personagem">Knipe</span> was slightly injured on his rounds.<br>
But on the whole, it was a satisfactory beginning. This last year – the first full year of the machine's operation – it was estimated that at least one half of all the novels and stories published in the English language were produced by <span class="nomeVermelho personagem">Adolph Knipe</span> upon the Great Automatic Grammatizator.<br>
Does this surprise you?<br>
I doubt it.<br>
And worse is yet to come. Today, as the secret spreads, many more are hurrying to tie up with Mr <span class="apelidoVermelho personagem">Knipe</span>. And all the time the screw turns tighter for those who hesitate to sign their names.<br>
This very moment, as I sit here listening to the howling of my nine starving children in the other room, I can feel my own hand creeping closer and closer to that golden contract that lies over on the other side of the desk.
Give us strength, Oh Lord, to let our children starve.
