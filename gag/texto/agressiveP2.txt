"<span class="apelidoVermelho personagem">Knipe</span>! Fine job you've done there, my boy."
"What, aren't you pleased?!"
"Did you even look at the papers this morning?"
"Aren't you proud, <span class="apelidoVermelho personagem">Knipe</span>? Get rid of that long face!"
"<span class="apelidoVermelho personagem">Knipe</span>, you dimwit. You've done a lot for the project. You and your little ideas were some of the only reasons the project isn't still on the drawing boards."
"<span class="apelidoVermelho personagem">Knipe</span>, stop looking so upset. What happened, your dog died or something?"
"Then go take a week's holiday. I don't want to have to look at your face anymore."
"<span class="apelidoVermelho personagem">Knipe</span>, you will go on this holiday. That's an order."
"Take a week. Hell, two weeks. I don't care. Go somewhere warm. Get some sunshine. Swim. Relax. Sleep. After that, get your ass back here and we'll talk about the future."
"God damn, <span class="apelidoVermelho personagem">Knipe</span>. You don't even look like the same man."
"Where the hell did you go on holiday?"
"<span class="apelidoVermelho personagem">Knipe</span>, you're out of your mind."
"Relax. Relax, and listen to me for one second, God damn it."
"Your... idea."
"It's ingenious, hell, almost brilliant and it shows what that little noggin is capable of, <span class="apelidoVermelho personagem">Knipe</span>. But it's just stupid. I mean, can you tell me one use we could have for this machine? Who the hell wants a story-writing machine? And where's the money gonna come from, huh? Tell me."
"...Fine. take a seat."
"Heh, sure. Go ahead."
"Get on with it, <span class="apelidoVermelho personagem">Knipe</span>. I'm here to help you out, but I don't want to waste a lot of time with some hot crispy kentucky fried bullshit."
"HAHA! A WRITER!"
"Holy crap, <span class="apelidoVermelho personagem">Knipe</span>! Why would you ever do that?"
"An urge?? Listen, this isn't the place for that type of conversation."
"What do you even do with those stories?!"
"At least you're doing slightly better than before now."
"Every now and then we all go through this. However, you have literal proof from the experts that your stories are really bad! It's time you retired from this hobbie. Forget about it. All of it."
"Now wait a minute..."
"Well, what would this even have to do with your machine?"
"Calm down, <span class="apelidoVermelho personagem">Knipe</span>! We're going nowhere if you keep hyperventilating like that!"
"Yes, this is very interesting but there's literally no point to it."
"You're out of your mind if you think this is a commercial proposition. Those machines actually cost a lot of money."
"What's the pay?"
"That's impossible. It's ridiculous!"
"So you're trying to tell me that these magazines just give away money for someone scribbling some stories together?! You're insane. So every writer's a millionaire now, huh?"
"<span class="apelidoVermelho personagem">Knipe</span>, you're crazy."
"This is still impossible to accomplish."
"Honestly now... There's no way they will buy them."
"How are you even going to sell them? Who's going to be credited for writing them?"
"This isn't funny, <span class="apelidoVermelho personagem">Knipe</span>. It stinks more than the back of your car."
"You're over-ambitious, <span class="apelidoVermelho personagem">Knipe</span>."
"Jesus Christ! Why would I even want that?"
"A writer..?"
"I mean, I would love to see the club-goers' stupid faces when my name appeared on those magazines."
"There's just one thing: where do the plots come from? You can't just make them appear out of thin air."
"Go on."
"Where?"
"Here's the plan. We lie about it, say it's just another of those mathematical machines, but a new version of it. Those idiots will have no idea whatsoever."
"Oh you're letting me pick? I have no idea, <span class="apelidoVermelho personagem">Knipe</span>! I'm not some big brain genius like you!"
"Get on with it, let's cut the foreplay."
"It'll never work."
"It'll never work,"
"I know it."
"WELL? Where's the rest?!"
"It stopped! It's broken!"
"It's nonsense!"
"It's sloppy, <span class="apelidoVermelho personagem">Knipe</span>!"
"I want a novel."
"I want a novel!"
"Everyone says I need to do a novel."
"The publishers are chasing me, begging for me to stop fooling around and do something important. A novel is the only way, that's what they say."
"Listen to me very carefully, now. I'm going to do a novel. A serious one. That will make them notice me. In fact, your little stories that you've been putting my name on are really getting on my nerves. Are you making a monkey out of me, <span class="apelidoVermelho personagem">Knipe</span>?"
"You know exactly what I mean. You're keeping the best stories for yourself and giving me the bad ones!"
"Oh you are. So this time I will make sure I write a high class book. You will not steal this from me."
"Holy crap, there's no way I'll ever work all that! It would be easier to just write the damn thing!"
"<span class="apelidoVermelho personagem">Knipe</span>, I am going to write an important novel or so help me god."
"Yes, yes, just pull the switch, damnit!"
"It was really hard work, <span class="apelidoVermelho personagem">Knipe</span>."
"Give it to me, I want to read it."
"What in the world is this?!"
"Look at this, this is outrageous!"
"Fruity?! It's insane! There's no way my name is going on that!"
"You're playing tricks on me, aren't you <span class="apelidoVermelho personagem">Knipe</span>?"
"Oh it sure looks like it."
"How would I ever know, you knobhead?"
"What do you even mean? You can't just absorb writers, you idiot."
"Whoa, <span class="apelidoVermelho personagem">Knipe</span>. Be careful now."
"There's no way they'll agree."
"Where's the creative urge, then, huh?"
"Great work, my boy."
"Why?"
"Why would she agree, then?!"
