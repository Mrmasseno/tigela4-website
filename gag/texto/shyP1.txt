"Oh, yes Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>..."
"No, sir, I didn't."
"I am sir."
"Yes Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>."
"Oh, I don't know, sir."
"All right, sir. If you wish."
"Of course,"
"it's completely ridiculous."
"It's a delicious idea, but so impracticable it doesn't really bear thinking about at all."
"Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>, could you take a look at this please?"
"Please, take a look."
"But I know it will work Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>..."
"May I sit down, sir?"
"I would like to explain something, Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>, if I may, about how I came to do all this."
"It's a sort of confession, I suppose, Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>. I think it explains why I've always been so… so kind of worried."
"You see, Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>, I don't really know how to say this but, I don't really care much for my work here. I know I'm good at it and all that sort of thing, but my heart's not in it. It's not what I want to do most."
"You see, sir, all my life I've wanted to be a writer."
"Yes, Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>. You may not believe it, but every bit of spare time I've had, I've spent writing stories. In the last ten years I've written hundreds, literally hundreds of short stories. Five hundred and sixty-six, to be precise. Approximately one a week."
"All I know, Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>, is I have the urge."
"The creative urge, Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>."
"Well, sir, that's the trouble. No one will buy them. Each time I finish one, I send it out on the rounds. It goes to one magazine after another. That's all that happens, Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>, and they simply send them back. It's very depressing."
"That's not true Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>... I know my stories are good, especially when you compare them to the boring stuff the magazines publish."
"..."
"Everything, Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>. What I want to tell you is, I've made a study of magazines, and it seems that each one tends to have its own particular type of story. The writers – the successful ones – know this, and they write accordingly."
"Please, Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>, hear me through..."
"So you see, on my machine, by having an adjustable coordinator between the 'plot-memory' section and the 'word-memory' section I am able to produce any type of story I desire simply by pressing the required button."
"The market is limited Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>. We've got to be able to produce the right stuff, at the right time, whenever we want it. It's a matter of business, that's all. I'm looking at it from your point of view now – as a commercial proposition."
"Yes, Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>, I do. But with due respect, you need to see how much the magazines pay writers for stories..."
"Anything up to twenty-five hundred dollars. It probably averages around a thousand."
"It's the truth Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>..."
"It's true Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>..."
"That's exactly it, Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>... I've got it all worked out. The big magazines are carrying approximately three fiction stories in each issue. Now, take the fifteen most important magazines – the ones paying the most money. A few of them are monthlies, but most of them come out every week. All right. That makes, let us say, around forty big stories being bought each week. That's forty thousand dollars. So with our machine – when we get it working properly – we can collar nearly the whole of this market."
"No, sir, honestly, it's true what I say. With volume alone we'll completely overwhelm them... This machine can produce a five-thousand-word story, all typed and ready for dispatch, in thirty seconds. How can the writers compete with that..?"
"Nowadays, Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>, the hand-made article hasn't a hope. It can't possibly compete with massproduction, especially in this country – you know that. Everything is done by machinery now. The quality may be inferior, but that doesn't matter. It's the cost of production that counts. And stories – well – they're just another product... and no one cares how you produce them so long as you deliver the goods. We'll sell them wholesale, Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>... We'll undercut every writer in the country."
"Forty thousand a week..."
"And if we halve the price, making it twenty thousand a week, that's still a million a year."
"I think that's more than what we would make from building the electric calculator, don't you think Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>?"
"I know that people in general would probably value more custom writen stories, but in a commercial point of view, they would probably choose the ones that are half the price anyway..."
"We'll set up our own literary agency, and we'll distribute them through that. And we'll invent all the names we want for the writers."
"And another thing, Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>. There's all manner of valuable by-products once you've got started. Take advertising, for example. Beer manufacturers and people like that are willing to pay good money these days if famous writers will lend their names to their products. I know this might seem a bit too much for now, but I really think we have a good chance."
"And we could just put your name is some of the stories... "
"Some writers get to be very much respected – like Mr Erle Gardner or Kathleen Morris, for example. We've got to have names, and I was certainly thinking of using my own on one or two stories..."
"Yes..."
"We feed those in, Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>. There's three or four hundred of them written down in that folder there on your left. Feed them straight into the 'plot-memory' section of the machine."
"There are many other little refinements too, Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>. You'll see them all when you study the plans carefully. For example, there's a trick that nearly every writer uses, of inserting at least one long, obscure word into each story. This makes the reader think that the man is very wise and clever. So I have the machine do the same thing..."
"In the 'word-memory' section,"
"Exactly..."
"Which button?"
"You choose. Lots of magazines to pick from – Saturday Evening Post, Collier's, Ladies" Home Journal – any one you like."
"Mr Bohlen,"
"Do you think you're ready? "
"OK... This one maybe, what do you think?"
"So much for the selection," 
"Now here we go... I hope it works..."
"That's it!"
"There's your story!"
"This is fine. It's probably just a loose cable somewhere..."
"Don't worry Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>!"
"It hasn't, this is exactly right, it's for the Digest Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>, it's suposed to be short!"
"It's simply that she's not breaking up the words. That's an easy adjustment..." 
"I told you Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>..."
"I think it's good..."
"And so you will. You just need to be a bit patient. This is a very complicated adjustment I have to make..."
"We're going to do novels,"
"Just as many as we want..."
"I don't know what you're talking about..."
"I'm really not."
"Look, Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>. With the sort of switchboard I'm rigging up, you'll be able to write any sort of book you want."
"You'll soon get used to it..."
"No doubt about it."
"Are you ready..?"
"Here you go."
"..."
"I must say it's a bit fruity Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>..."
"I guess you're right..."
"That's not true..."
"Maybe you just pressed a little too hard on the passion pedals Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>."
"Just try again..."
"See here, Mr Bohlen," 
"We still got too much competition... I think we should just try to absorb the rest of the writers sir."
"Of course you can Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>... Exactly like Rockefeller did with his oil companies. Simply buy 'em out, and if they won't sell, squeeze 'em out."
"I've got a list here Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>, of fifty of the most successful writers in the country, and what I intend to do
is offer each one of them a lifetime contract with pay. All they have to do is undertake never to write
another word; and, of course, to let us use their names on our own stuff."
"Writers are only interested in one thing..."
"All they're really interested in is the money – just like everybody else..."
"Come with me and see it with your own eyes..."
"All right,"
"you want to do a book now?"
"That's one of them out of the way..."
"And you know why she signed?
"It wasn't the money..."
"Simply because she saw the machine-made stuff was better than her own."
