"Well, <span class="apelidoVermelho personagem">Knipe</span>, my boy. Now that it's finished, I need to congratulate you, because you've done a wonderful job."
"Aren't you pleased, <span class="apelidoVermelho personagem">Knipe</span>?"
"Did you happen to see what the papers said this morning?"
"Aren't you proud, <span class="apelidoVermelho personagem">Knipe</span>? Aren't you pleased?"
"I don't think I have to remind you that your own contribution, especially to the original plans, was an important one. In fact, I might go so far as to say that without you and some of your ideas, this project might still be on the drawing-boards today."
"Is anything bothering you, <span class="apelidoVermelho personagem">Knipe</span>? Anything on your mind that you need to talk about?"
"How would you like to take a week"s holiday? Do you good. You've earned it."
"I'd really like you to take a holiday, <span class="apelidoVermelho personagem">Knipe</span>. You need it."
"Take a week. Two weeks if you like. Go somewhere warm. Get some sunshine. Swim. Relax. Sleep. Then come back, and we'll have another talk about the future."
"<span class="apelidoVermelho personagem">Knipe</span>, good gracious me, you look really tired. Was the time you took not enough? I can give you more if you feel like you need to rest still"
"That's really ambitious <span class="apelidoVermelho personagem">Knipe</span>, but it seems really complicated."
"I've no doubt of that <span class="apelidoVermelho personagem">Knipe</span>, but just listen to me."
"Take it easy now, <span class="apelidoVermelho personagem">Knipe</span>. Take it easy, and listen to me."
"Your idea,"
"is very ambitious – I might almost say brilliant – and it only goes to confirm my opinion of your abilities, <span class="apelidoVermelho personagem">Knipe</span>. But maybe you shouldn't take it too seriously. After all, my boy, what possible use can it be to us? Who would want a machine for writing stories? And would it really be worth it?"
"Please do."
"Go right ahead, <span class="apelidoVermelho personagem">Knipe</span>."
"You tell me anything you want, <span class="apelidoVermelho personagem">Knipe</span>. I"m here to help you – you know that."
"A writer? I didn't know that."
"Wow, that's a lot of work <span class="apelidoVermelho personagem">Knipe</span>, do you have the energy for all of that?"
"What sort of urge?"
"And may I ask you what you do with these stories, <span class="apelidoVermelho personagem">Knipe</span>?"
"I can see quite well how you feel, my boy." His voice was dripping with sympathy.
"We all go through it one time or another in our lives. But given your responses do really think it's worth to keep going? Maybe you should just forget about it."
"Now wait a minute, my boy …"
"You'll pardon me, <span class="apelidoVermelho personagem">Knipe</span>, but what"s all this got to do with your machine?"
"Just a minute, my boy. Calm yourself down. I just don't think all this is getting us anywhere."
"Yes, I know, <span class="apelidoVermelho personagem">Knipe</span>, I know. It seem very interesting, but what"s the point of it?"
"My dear boy, it can't possibly be a commercial proposition – ever. You know as well as I do what it costs to build one of these machines."
"What do they pay?"
"It can't be <span class="apelidoVermelho personagem">Knipe</span>! That's outrageous!"
"You mean to sit there and tell me that these magazines pay out money like that to a man for … just for scribbling off a story! Good heavens, <span class="apelidoVermelho personagem">Knipe</span>! Whatever next! Writers must all be millionaires!"
"My dear boy, this seems a bit crazy."
"I still think it"s impracticable, <span class="apelidoVermelho personagem">Knipe</span>."
"But seriously now, <span class="apelidoVermelho personagem">Knipe</span>. D'you really think they'd buy them?"
"And how will you sell them? Who will you say has written them?"
"I don't know, <span class="apelidoVermelho personagem">Knipe</span>. To me, that smacks of trickery, does it not?"
"That's really ambitious, my boy."
"I don't know, <span class="apelidoVermelho personagem">Knipe</span>. What should I want that for?"
"A writer, eh?"
"Well, it would surely surprise them over at the club when they saw my name in the magazines – the good magazines."
"One thing I don't quite understand, <span class="apelidoVermelho personagem">Knipe</span>. Where do the plots come from? The machine can't possibly invent plots."
"Go on."
"Where?"
"What we'll have to do, <span class="apelidoVermelho personagem">Knipe</span>, is to say that we"re merely building another mathematical calculator, but of a new type. That'll keep the secret."
"Goodness me, boy! How do I know?"
"Okay <span class="apelidoVermelho personagem">Knipe</span>, let's do this then."
"I don't think this will work..."
"I'm really not sure about this,"
"I'm really not sure."
"But where"s the rest?"
"It stopped already..."
"Just seems like gibberish to me."
"Seems a bit sloppy to me, my boy!"
"Maybe I should do a novel,"
"I want to do a novel."
"Everyone tells me I ought to do a novel,"
"All sorts of publishers are chasing after me day and night begging me to stop fooling around with stories and do something really important instead. A novel"s the only thing that counts – that"s what they say."
"I really want this to be a good story <span class="apelidoVermelho personagem">Knipe</span>, I've been noticing that the one's that you put my name on happen to be the most lackluster ones... Now people think that I'm a monkey..."
"I feel like you've been keeping the best ones for your self <span class="apelidoVermelho personagem">Knipe</span>..."
"Please make sure that the book that comes out next time is a good one please..."
"<span class="apelidoVermelho personagem">Knipe</span>, it don't really think I'll be able to do that"
"I want to write an important novel, <span class="apelidoVermelho personagem">Knipe</span>." 
"Yes, I"m ready."
"It sure was hard work, my boy."
"Let me see it, <span class="apelidoVermelho personagem">Knipe</span>. How does it read?"
"This doesn't look promissing <span class="apelidoVermelho personagem">Knipe</span>."
"But look here, <span class="apelidoVermelho personagem">Knipe</span>! This is outrageous!"
"Fruity? This seems really innapropriate, I can't possibly put my name to this..."
"Are you trying to pull a trick on me <span class="apelidoVermelho personagem">Knipe</span>?"
"It kinda looks like it."
"My dear boy, how should I know?"
"Don't know what you mean, my boy. You can't just absorb writers."
"Careful now, <span class="apelidoVermelho personagem">Knipe</span>. Be careful."
"They'll never agree."
"What about the creative urge, <span class="apelidoVermelho personagem">Knipe</span>?"
"Nice work, my boy."
"Why?"
"Then why?"
