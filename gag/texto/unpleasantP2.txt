"Well, <span class="apelidoVermelho personagem">Knipe</span>. Now that it's finished, I just called you in to tell you I think you've done a good job."
"Aren't you pleased?"
"Did you even read the papers this morning?"
"Aren't you proud, <span class="apelidoVermelho personagem">Knipe</span>? Aren't you pleased?"
"Your contribution to the original plans was important, but next time you should turn it in faster, we're losing money for every additional minute you waste doing nothing."
"What's bothering you? Do you have something to say to me?"
"Do you think you deserve a holiday just because you worked a little?"
"You will take a holiday, I'm feeling nice today and you look awful, I don't want anymore late work coming from you."
"Take a week, see if you can rest a little and organize the thoughts in that big head of yours, but when you come back you better be working faster than Speedy Gonzalez."
"Wow <span class="apelidoVermelho personagem">Knipe</span>, did you spend your holiday dumpster diving? You look trashed"
"You look terrible."
"You're insane, did you get any sleep these days?"
"Listen to me, you delusional kid"
"This idea,"
"is very stupid – I might almost say dumb – and it only goes to confirm my opinion of you, <span class="apelidoVermelho personagem">Knipe</span>. I'm sure you're not serious. After all, what possible use can it be me? Who on earth wants a machine for writing stories? And where's the money in it, anyway? You're wasting my time kid."
"Hum"
"Sure <span class="apelidoVermelho personagem">Knipe</span>, whatever."
"Stop rambling and get to the point"
"A writer?!"
"Good heavens, man! What on earth did you do that for?"
"What are you talking about?"
"And may I ask you what you do with these stories, <span class="apelidoVermelho personagem">Knipe</span>?"
"Of course no one will buy them, who would care for your stories?."
"It's probably just a phase. But now – now that you've had proof – positive proof – from the experts themselves, from the editors, that your stories are – what shall I say – rather bad, it's time to leave off. Forget it. Just forget all about it."
"Now wait a minute…"
"What's all this got to do with your machine?"
"Calm yourself down, will you. I don't think all this is getting anywhere."
"Yeah it all seems very interesting..."
"What's the point ?"
"It can't possibly be a commercial proposition – ever. You know as well as I do what it costs to build one of these machines."
"What do they pay?"
"Absolutely impossible, <span class="apelidoVermelho personagem">Knipe</span>! Ridiculous!"
"You mean to sit there and tell me that these magazines pay out money like that to a man for… just for scribbling off a story! Good heavens! Whatever next! Writers must all be millionaires!"
"You're obviously mad!"
"I still think it's impracticable."
"But seriously now. D"you really think they'd buy them?"
"And how will you sell them? Who will you say has written them?"
"That smacks of trickery to me, does it not?"
"Don't get too ambitious kid."
"And what should I want that for?"
"A writer, eh?"
"Well, it would surely surprise them over at the club when they saw my name in the magazines – the good magazines."
"One thing I don't quite understand, <span class="apelidoVermelho personagem">Knipe</span>. Where do the plots come from? The machine can't possibly invent plots."
"Go on."
"What we'll have to do, <span class="apelidoVermelho personagem">Knipe</span>, is to say that we're merely building another mathematical calculator, but of a new type. That'll keep the secret."
"Goodness me, kid! How do I know?"
"Listen, <span class="apelidoVermelho personagem">Knipe</span>, just get on with it  and cut out the chit chat."
"This will never work, you're wasting my time and my patience kid!"
"It'll never work,"
"I know it'll never work."
"Where's the rest?"
"It's stopped! It's gone wrong!"
"What the hell is this?! It's gibberish!"
"Seems a bit sloppy to me, kid!"
"I want to do a novel,"
"I want to do a novel"
"Everyone tells me I ought to do a novel,"
"All sorts of publishers are chasing after me day and night begging me to stop fooling around with stories and do something really important instead. A novel's the only thing that counts – that's what they say."
"Now listen to me, kid. What I'm going to do is a serious novel, something that'll make 'em sit up and take notice. I've been getting rather tired of the sort of stories you've been putting my name to lately. As a matter of fact, I'm none too sure you haven't been trying to make a monkey out of me!"
"Keeping all the best ones for yourself, that's what you've been doing you trickster!"
"So this time I'm going to make damn sure I write a high class intelligent book. You understand
that."
"Good God! I'll never be able to do all that! Dammit, man, it'd be easier to write the thing by hand!" 
"I intend to write an important novel, <span class="apelidoVermelho personagem">Knipe</span>."
"Yes, yes, I'm ready."
"After all the hard work."
"Let me see it, is it good?"
"What is this?! This is outrageous!"
"Fruity! It's perfectly revolting! I can't possibly put my name to this!"
"<span class="apelidoVermelho personagem">Knipe</span>! Is this some nasty trick you've been playing on me?"
"It certainly looks like it!"
"And should I know that?"
"Don't know what you mean. You can't just absorb writers."
"Careful now, <span class="apelidoVermelho personagem">Knipe</span>. Be careful."
"They'll never agree."
"What about the creative urge, <span class="apelidoVermelho personagem">Knipe</span>?"
"Nice work."
"Why?"
"Then why?"
