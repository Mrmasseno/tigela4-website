"Oh yes, Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>."
"No, sir, I didn't."
"Of course, Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>."
"Oh no, Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>. No."
"Oh, I don't know, sir."
"All right, sir. If you wish."
"Of course,"
"it's completely ridiculous."
"It's a delicious idea, but so impracticable it doesn't really bear thinking about at all."
"Look, Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>!"
"Look at these!"
"But Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>! It'll work! I've proved to you it'll work! You can't deny that!"
"May I sit down, sir?"
"I would like to explain something, Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>, if I may, about how I came to do all this."
"It's a sort of confession, I suppose, Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>. I think it explains why I've always been so ... so kind of worried."
"You see, Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>, to tell the honest truth, I don't really care much for my work here. I know I'm good at it and all that sort of thing, but my heart's not in it. It's not what I want to do most."
"You see, sir, all my life I've wanted to be a writer."
"Yes, Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>. You may not believe it, but every bit of spare time I've had, I've spent writing stories. In the last ten years I've written hundreds, literally hundreds of short stories. Five hundred and sixty-six, to be precise. Approximately one a week."
"All I know, sir, is I have the urge."
"The creative urge, Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>."
"Well, sir, that's the trouble. No one will buy them. Each time I finish one, I send it out on the rounds. It goes to one magazine after another. That's all that happens, Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>, and they simply send them back. It's very depressing."
"No, Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>! No! That's not true! I know my stories are good. My heavens, when you compare them with the stuff some of those magazines print – oh my word, Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>! – the sloppy, boring stuff that you see in the magazines week after week – why, it drives me mad!"
"Do you ever read the magazines, Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>?"
"Everything, Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>, absolutely everything! What I want to tell you is, I've made a study of magazines, and it seems that each one tends to have its own particular type of story. The writers – the successful ones – know this, and they write accordingly."
"Please, Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>, hear me through. It's all terribly important."
"So you see, on my machine, by having an adjustable co- ordinator between the 'plot-memory' section and the 'word-memory' section I am able to produce any type of story I desire simply by pressing the required button."
"Just this, Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>. The market is limited. We've got to be able to produce the right stuff, at the right time, whenever we want it. It's a matter of business, that's all. I'm looking at it from your point of view now – as a commercial proposition."
"Yes, sir, I do. But with due respect, I don't believe you know what the magazines pay writers for stories."
"Anything up to twenty-five hundred dollars. It probably averages around a thousand."
"Yes, sir, it's true."
"No, sir, it's true."
"That's exactly it, Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>! That's where the machine comes in. Listen a minute, sir, while I tell you some more. I've got it all worked out. The big magazines are carrying approximately three fiction stories in each issue. Now, take the fifteen most important magazines – the ones paying the most money. A few of them are monthlies, but most of them come out every week. All right. That makes, let us say, around forty big stories being bought each week. That's forty thousand dollars. So with our machine – when we get it working properly – we can collar nearly the whole of this market!"
"No, sir, honestly, it's true what I say. Don't you see that with volume alone we'll completely overwhelm them! This machine can produce a five-thousand-word story, all typed and ready for dispatch, in thirty seconds. How can the writers compete with that? I ask you, Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>, how?"
"Nowadays, Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>, the hand-made article hasn't a hope. It can't possibly compete with mass-production, especially in this country – you know that. Carpets... chairs... shoes... bricks... crockery... anything you like to mention – they're all made by machinery now. The quality may be inferior, but that doesn't matter. It's the cost of production that counts. And stories – well – they're just another product, like carpets and chairs, and no one cares how you produce them so long as you deliver the goods. We'll sell them wholesale, Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>! We'll undercut every writer in the country! We'll corner the market!"
"Forty thousand a week!"
"And if we halve the price, making it twenty thousand a week, that's still a million a year!"
"You didn't get any million a year for building the old electronic calculator, did you, Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>?"
"Listen, Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>. Who on earth is going to want custom-made stories when they can get the other kind at half the price? It stands to reason, doesn't it?"
"We'll set up our own literary agency, and we'll distribute them through that. And we'll invent all the names we want for the writers."
"And another thing, Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>. There's all manner of valuable by-products once you've got started. Take advertising, for example. Beer manufacturers and people like that are willing to pay good money these days if famous writers will lend their names to their products. Why, my heavens, Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>! This isn't any children's plaything we're talking about. It's big business."
"And another thing. There isn't any reason why we shouldn't put your name, Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>, on some of the better stories, if you wished it."
"I don't know, sir, except that some writers get to be very much respected – like Mr Erle Gardner or Kathleen Morris, for example. We've got to have names, and I was certainly thinking of using my own on one or two stories, just to help out."
"That's right, Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>!"
"We feed those in, sir. That's no problem at all. Everyone has plots. There's three or four hundred of them written down in that folder there on your left. Feed them straight into the 'plot-memory' section of the machine."
"There are many other little refinements too, Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>. You'll see them all when you study the plans carefully. For example, there's a trick that nearly every writer uses, of inserting at least one long, obscure word into each story. This makes the reader think that the man is very wise and clever. So I have the machine do the same thing. There'll be a whole stack of long words stored away just for this purpose."
"In the 'word-memory' section,"
"Exactly, Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>."
"Which button?"
"You choose, Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>. Lots of magazines to pick from – Saturday Evening Post, Collier's, Ladies' Home Journal – any one you like."
"Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>,"
"do you realize that at this moment, with your little finger alone, you have it in your power to become the most versatile writer on this continent?"
"OK, Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>. Then we'll make it ... let me see – this one. How's that?"
"So much for the selection,"
"Now – here we go!"
"That's it!"
"There's your story!"
"It's all right, sir. Really it is. It only needs a little adjustment. We've got a connection wrong somewhere, that's all. You must remember, Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>, there's over a million feet of wiring in this room. You can't expect everything to be right first time"
"Be patient, sir. Be patient"
"No sir, it hasn't. It's exactly right. It's for the Digest, don't you see?"
"No, sir, it's fine. Can't you see? It's simply that she's not breaking up the words. That's an easy adjustment. But the story's there. Look, Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>, look! It's all there except that the words are joined together."
"It's tremendous, Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>! It's exactly right!"
"No, sir, it's a seller, a real seller!"
"And so you will, sir. And so you will. But please be patient. This is a very complicated adjustment I have to make."
"We're going to do novels,"
"Just as many as we want. But please be patient."
"A monkey, Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>?"
"Oh no, Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>! No!"
"Look, Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>. With the sort of switchboard I'm rigging up, you'll be able to write any sort of book you want."
"You'll soon get used to it, Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>, I promise you. In a week or two, you'll be doing it without hardly thinking. It's just like learning to drive."
"I'm sure you will, sir. I'm sure you will."
"Are you ready, sir?"
"Congratulations on your first novel,"
"But you got it done, sir. You got it done."
"I must say it's a bit fruity, sir."
"Quite right, sir. Quite right!"
"Oh no, sir! No!"
"You don't think, Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>, that you mightn't have been pressing a little hard on the passion-control pedals, do you?"
"Why don't you try another?"
"See here, Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>,"
"We still got too much competition. Why don't we just absorb all the other writers in the country?"
"Of course you can, sir. Exactly like Rockefeller did with his oil companies. Simply buy 'em out, and if they won't sell, squeeze 'em out. It's easy!"
"I've got a list here sir, of fifty of the most successful writers in the country, and what I intend to do is offer each one of them a lifetime contract with pay. All they have to do is undertake never to write another word; and, of course, to let us use their names on our own stuff. How about that?"
"You don't know writers, Mr <span class="apelidoAzul personagem">Bohlen</span>. You watch and see."
"It's bunk! All they're really interested in is the money – just like everybody else."
"Madam,"
"Come with me and see it with your own eyes. My car awaits you."
"All right,"
"you want to do a book now?"
"That's one of them out of the way,"
"A pretty big one too."
"And you know why she signed?"
"It wasn't the money. She's got plenty of that."
"Simply because she saw the machine-made stuff was better than her own."
