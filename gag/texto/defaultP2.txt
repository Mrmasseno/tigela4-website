"Well, <span class="apelidoVermelho personagem">Knipe</span>, my boy. Now that it's finished, I just called you in to tell you I think you've done a fine job."
"Aren't you pleased?"
"Did you see what the papers said this morning?"
"Aren't you proud, <span class="apelidoVermelho personagem">Knipe</span>? Aren't you pleased?"
"I don't think I have to remind you that your own contribution, especially to the original plans, was an important one. In fact, I might go so far as to say that without you and some of your ideas, this project might still be on the drawing-boards today."
"Is anything bothering you, <span class="apelidoVermelho personagem">Knipe</span>? Anything on your mind?"
"How would you like to take a week's holiday? Do you good. You've earned it."
"I'd like you to take a holiday, <span class="apelidoVermelho personagem">Knipe</span>. You need it."
"Take a week. Two weeks if you like. Go somewhere warm. Get some sunshine. Swim. Relax. Sleep. Then come back, and we'll have another talk about the future."
"Well, <span class="apelidoVermelho personagem">Knipe</span>, good gracious me, you look a hundred per cent better. You have a good holiday? Where'd you go?"
"You look a hundred per cent better, my boy."
"You know what I think, <span class="apelidoVermelho personagem">Knipe</span>? I think you're nuts."
"Take it easy now, <span class="apelidoVermelho personagem">Knipe</span>. Take it easy, and listen to me."
"This idea,"
"is very ingenious – I might almost say brilliant – and it only goes to confirm my opinion of your abilities, <span class="apelidoVermelho personagem">Knipe</span>. But don't take it too seriously. After all, my boy, what possible use can it be to us? Who on earth wants a machine for writing stories? And where's the money in it, anyway? Just tell me that."
"Sure, take a seat."
"Go right ahead, <span class="apelidoVermelho personagem">Knipe</span>."
"You tell me anything you want, <span class="apelidoVermelho personagem">Knipe</span>. I'm here to help you – you know that."
"A writer!"
"Good heavens, man! What on earth did you do that for?"
"What sort of urge?"
"And may I ask you what you do with these stories, <span class="apelidoVermelho personagem">Knipe</span>?"
"I can see quite well how you feel, my boy."
"We all go through it one time or another in our lives. But now – now that you've had proof – positive proof – from the experts themselves, from the editors, that your stories are – what shall I say – rather unsuccessful, it's time to leave off. Forget it, my boy. Just forget all about it."
"Now wait a minute, my boy ..."
"You'll pardon me, <span class="apelidoVermelho personagem">Knipe</span>, but what's all this got to do with your machine?"
"Just a minute, my boy. Calm yourself down, will you. I don't think all this is getting us anywhere."
"Yes, I know, <span class="apelidoVermelho personagem">Knipe</span>, I know. This is all very interesting, but what's the point of it?"
"My dear boy, it can't possibly be a commercial proposition – ever. You know as well as I do what it costs to build one of these machines."
"What do they pay?"
"Absolutely impossible, <span class="apelidoVermelho personagem">Knipe</span>! Ridiculous!"
"You mean to sit there and tell me that these magazines pay out money like that to a man for ... just for scribbling off a story! Good heavens, <span class="apelidoVermelho personagem">Knipe</span>! Whatever next! Writers must all be millionaires!"
"My dear boy, you're mad!"
"I still think it's impracticable, <span class="apelidoVermelho personagem">Knipe</span>."
"But seriously now, <span class="apelidoVermelho personagem">Knipe</span>. D'you really think they'd buy them?"
"And how will you sell them? Who will you say has written them?"
"I don't like it, <span class="apelidoVermelho personagem">Knipe</span>. To me, that smacks of trickery, does it not?"
"Don't get too ambitious, my boy."
"My goodness, <span class="apelidoVermelho personagem">Knipe</span>. What should I want that for?"
"A writer, eh?"
"Well, it would surely surprise them over at the club when they saw my name in the magazines – the good magazines."
"One thing I don't quite understand, <span class="apelidoVermelho personagem">Knipe</span>. Where do the plots come from? The machine can't possibly invent plots."
"Go on."
"Where?"
"What we'll have to do, <span class="apelidoVermelho personagem">Knipe</span>, is to say that we're merely building another mathematical calculator, but of a new type. That'll keep the secret."
"Goodness me, boy! How do I know?"
"Listen, <span class="apelidoVermelho personagem">Knipe</span>, just get on with it, will you please – and cut out the preliminaries."
"It'll never work,"
"It'll never work,"
"I know it'll never work."
"Where's the rest?"
"It's stopped! It's gone wrong!"
"It's gibberish!"
"Seems a bit sloppy to me, my boy!"
"I want to do a novel,"
"I want to do a novel."
"Everyone tells me I ought to do a novel,"
"All sorts of publishers are chasing after me day and night begging me to stop fooling around with stories and do something really important instead. A novel's the only thing that counts – that's what they say."
"Now listen to me, <span class="apelidoVermelho personagem">Knipe</span>. What I'm going to do is a serious novel, something that'll make 'em sit up and take notice. I've been getting rather tired of the sort of stories you've been putting my name to lately. As a matter of fact, I'm none too sure you haven't been trying to make a monkey out of me."
"Keeping all the best ones for yourself, that's what you've been doing."
"So this time I'm going to make damn sure I write a high class intelligent book. You understand that."
"Good God, <span class="apelidoVermelho personagem">Knipe</span>! I'll never be able to do all that! Dammit, man, it'd be easier to write the thing by hand!"
"I intend to write an important novel, <span class="apelidoVermelho personagem">Knipe</span>."
"Yes, yes, I'm ready."
"It sure was hard work, my boy."
"Let me see it, <span class="apelidoVermelho personagem">Knipe</span>. How does it read?"
"Good heavens, <span class="apelidoVermelho personagem">Knipe</span>! What's this!"
"But look here, <span class="apelidoVermelho personagem">Knipe</span>! This is outrageous!"
"Fruity! It's perfectly revolting! I can't possibly put my name to this!"
"<span class="apelidoVermelho personagem">Knipe</span>! Is this some nasty trick you've been playing on me?"
"It certainly looks like it."
"My dear boy, how should I know?"
"Don't know what you mean, my boy. You can't just absorb writers."
"Careful now, <span class="apelidoVermelho personagem">Knipe</span>. Be careful."
"They'll never agree."
"What about the creative urge, <span class="apelidoVermelho personagem">Knipe</span>?"
"Nice work, my boy."
"Why?"
"Then why?"
